 ('4', '8', 'en_us', 'Hard as Life', '<p>Stubbornness is one of my defining characteristics.  There is a voice in my head at all times that is a cheeky and rather brutally honest critic.  I do not always listen to him because, let\'s be fair, such personalities are exhausting and particularly frustrating when you just want to ignore work/responsibilities/life.  But, he\'s there and without that voice constantly pushing me I would have never gotten back to a state that would allow me to attempt hiking the entirety of the Pacific Crest Trail.</p><p>So.  Here I am four weeks away from starting that journey and the excitement is starting to build.  Amelia has been fiddling and testing and researching with glee and determination for most of the past three months; while I have been rather more leisurely about my preparations.  Steps were mapped out in my mind, of course.  I perused gear reviews and blog entries in my off hours, bookmarked webpages, created a spreadsheet for gear costs and weights, and set money aside for purchases.   Yet, it was not until the beginning of March that my relative languid behavior disappeared and I started seriously concentrating on the task before me.</p><p>All the gear except a few middling items have now been purchased.  I am still waiting for a shirt and a stove to appear on my doorstep from the USPS fairy (I have yet to actually <i>see</i> our mailman), but all other incidental items can likely be procured in a single afternoon.   A significant pile of dried meals has been ordered from <a href=\"http://outdoorherbivore.com\">Outdoor Herbivore</a> and will be allocated to specific resupply boxes later this week.  Plane tickets are purchased and sleeping quarters arranged in San Diego for the night before the hike starts.</p><p>Yup.  All coming together.</p><p>The planning and preparations never really concerned me as much as they did Amelia.  Much of my formative years were spent exploring forests and I have extensive backpacking experience from previous trips.  Ultralight backpacking is reasonably new to me, but I have always been careful to choose the best gear for my outdoor activities, which has helped me have a pack weight that is significantly less than people who are still using packs purchased in the 80s.  As a man whose metabolism still burns fiercely, food intake to me is as much about fuel as taste so I will eat almost anything put in front of me.   While my concern for all these things is not exactly lighthearted, it borders a bit on laissez-faire.  We shall just see how the gear and food goes, no?</p><p>What is on my mind is the reliability of my body.  Last year at this time is when Amelia visited me in Portland after her stint in Antarctica and trip around New Zealand.  She told me the other day that what she remembers of that visit is me still limping and becoming tired after walking just a mile.  10 months ago I was still scared of uneven ground for fear my knee would collapse on me.  6 months ago is when I went for my first 2 minute jog.  3 months ago, I snowshoed up solo to a remote fire lookout.  A month ago I finally did a trail run that lasted over an hour (full disclosure: very sore afterwards).   And, right now I am rotating between days of walking 6-8 miles or spending two hours in the gym doing weights, rowing, and stationary biking.</p><p>My knee will never be 100% again, I understand that.  As my physical therapist joked, I no longer have original factory parts.  I tore it up pretty bad and it will never be completely reliable.  Rubbing the scar tissue in my tendon has become somewhat habit forming.  But, in the past year I have worked desperately to restore as much strength and functionality as possible.  Strong enough to <i>attempt</i> a 2,600 mile backpacking trip.  Not strong enough to feel remotely certain of finishing.</p><p>In all fairness, I am giving myself even odds of making it through the first month.  Even disregarding the knee, I have not treated my body gently these past three decades.  Years of soccer, running, backpacking, mountaineering, and shenanigans have taken a toll.  It has been a well lived life, in my opinion, but I am now starting to deal with the complications of that hard playing.  Lots of muscles, tendons, and ligaments are infused with scar tissue.  Backpacking 2,600 miles is not going to treat them kindly.</p><p>And yet, why the hell not try.<br></p><blockquote>\"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.\"</blockquote>\r\n', '2013-03-27 05:06:36', '2015-11-10 06:47:10', '270ca66b-701a-45e9-bcc3-c36ace8e38b0'),
 ('5', '9', 'en_us', 'What\'s for Dinner?', '<p>\r\n	As one would imagine, when you are hiking for 8-10 hours every day for months on end, food is an important consideration. &nbsp; I particularly love this tidbit from the <a href=\"http://planyourhike.com/food/\">Plan Your Hike</a> website:\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n	The Basal metabolic rate requirement of food calories is approximately 1,000 per day per 100 pounds of body weight.&nbsp;This means you need to eat about 1,000 calories per 100 pounds of body weight per day to survive without losing weight under normal conditions.<br>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\r\n	Does that seem low to you? &nbsp;I am an 180 pound male who exercises regularly and I definitely eat around 3,000 calories a day. So, I am estimating that I will need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day for the entire trip, minimum. &nbsp;To give you some perspective on what would be required to intake that many calories, here are a few foods and the quantities required to reach 5,000 calories (<a href=\"http://nutritiondata.self.com\">source</a>):\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Olive Oil - 42 Tablesppons</li>\r\n	<li>Peanut Butter - 53 Tablespoons</li>\r\n	<li>Snickers - 18.5 regular bars</li>\r\n	<li>Whole Almonds - 6 cups (1.9 lbs)</li>\r\n	<li>Dried Quinoa - 8 cups (3 lbs)</li>\r\n	<li>Muesli - 17 cups (3.2 lbs)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	The foods listed there are considered relatively calorie dense for their weight too. &nbsp;The average PCT thru-hiker will be consuming about 2-2.5 pounds of food a day and even then most will lose 5-15 pounds of weight during their trip. &nbsp;I am a fairly lean guy already, so the process of keeping my body fueled and healthy is in the forefront of my thoughts now that all of my gear is purchased and ready.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	While the calorie quantity and weight of the food is important, it also has to meet all the nutritional requirements that the strain of the trail puts on your body. &nbsp;An often cited resource for thru hikers is&nbsp;Dr. Braaten\'s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thru-hiker.com/articles/pack_light_eat_right.php\">Pack Light, Eat Right</a> website. &nbsp;She covers everything from protein content to vitamins, as well as some recommended foods and recipes. &nbsp;Thankfully, as Amelia frequently says, I am a good eater. &nbsp;Put food in front of me and I will eat it. Even on mountains and in cold weather, my mind is so used to eating on a constant basis that even if I am not feeling hungry I am programmed to continue putting anything consumable within reach into my mouth.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	That being said, I do appreciate having a hot, tasty meal that has absolutely nothing to do with energy bars, trail mix, soup mixes, or potato flakes. &nbsp;Since I am being resupplied five times via mail drop while in California, those boxes seemed like a perfect time to throw in a half dozen lightweight backpacking meals. &nbsp;Researching a half dozen dried and freeze dried meal companies online, I settled on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://outdoorherbivore.com\">Outdoor Herbivore</a>. &nbsp;Their meals looked the most appetizing and were extremely price competitive compared to a company like Mountain House. &nbsp;They also have a fantastic 15%&nbsp;bulk discount on orders over $200, which sealed the deal. &nbsp;I went through their website last Monday and chose twelve different meals, which were delivered at the end of last week:\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<img src=\"http://shapelesschaos.com/assets/uploads/food.png\" style=\"width:640px;height:auto;\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Bought two Hungry Double sized packages of the following meals:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>AppalaChia</li>\r\n	<li>Bee Good Couscous</li>\r\n	<li>Blackened Quinoa</li>\r\n	<li>Cheddar\' Mac</li>\r\n	<li>Chia Oat Crunch</li>\r\n	<li>Coconut Chia Peel</li>\r\n	<li>Ginger Chia Gooey</li>\r\n	<li>Naked Freckle Burrito</li>\r\n	<li>Savory Lentil Simmer</li>\r\n	<li>Sunny Sunflower Salad</li>\r\n	<li>Switchback Soup & Stuffer</li>\r\n	<li>Toasted Sunburst Muesli</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>\r\n	If you want to see how the different meals compare on price/weight/calories, I created a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://shapelesschaos.com/assets/uploads/Outdoor_Herbivore.pdf\">spreadsheet</a> that breaks it all down. &nbsp;Even with their excellent prices, if I bought only these meals for the entirety of my trip, the cost to feed me for the entire trip would be approximately $4,400. &nbsp;That is <em>not</em> including any money I spent on restaurant food during zero mileage days in town. &nbsp;Bit pricey. &nbsp;But for the occasional treat during mail resupply, I think they are going to be extremely welcomed.&nbsp;\r\n</p>', '2013-03-31 06:28:26', '2015-11-10 06:47:11', '37002f43-78aa-4f29-abc6-ce43ea6a4452'),

These two PCT alums just started hiking the Appalachian Trail and right off the bat Shutterbug developed a knee problem. &nbsp;Shin splints, twisted ankles, knee pain: the trail is unkind and a problematic injury can happen to <em>anyone</em>. &nbsp;Combine a painful injury with long days and not enough food, and it is enough to make anyone quit. &nbsp;I hear Northern California with its relative lack of towns is particularly problematic for people. &nbsp;I know that I for one have a hard time reining myself in and could easily burn out or break down by not taking adequate rest days.</p><p>\r\n	None of these are huge, worrisome concerns but they are on the back burner in my mind. &nbsp;Expectations are an important part of making a long trip go well and I am trying to manage them as best I can before starting off.</p>', '2013-04-03 22:18:25', '2015-11-10 06:47:11', '9f601294-f4ff-400f-beb8-e2571990e727'),

Beats organizing that pile of important documents into my filing bin.</p><p><strong>What is the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT)?</strong></p><p>In short, it is a 2,650 mile backpacking trail stretching from the California/Mexico border all the way to Canada through the states of California, Oregon, and Washington.  It usually takes a bit under 5 months to complete with most people going north and starting in late April. The Smithsonian Magazine just published a well written <a href=\"http://blogs.smithsonianmag.com/adventure/2013/04/going-the-distance-on-the-pacific-crest-trail/\">article</a> about it the other day.  You can also look at the <a href=\"http://www.pcta.org\">Pacific Crest Trail Association</a>\'s website for more details.</p><p><strong>When are you starting?<br></strong></p><p>April 22nd.  We fly down to San Diego on the afternoon of the 21st and start early the next morning at the Mexican border near Campo, CA.

If you want a nice, simple overview map, I suggest this <a href=\"http://www.pctmap.net/pctdownloads/pct_overview_2pg.pdf\">two page color map</a>.  I will be posting irregular updates of my position on my <a href=\"http://twitter.com/reedmaniac\">Twitter account</a> and Facebook, but I am not intending to meet friends/acquaintances on the trail or really keep a \"Where is Paul?\" page.</p><p><strong>Who is this Amelia character?<br></strong></p><p>She is self described as \"about as even-tempered as a hornet, and as social as an oyster\" and is probably my favorite friend.  Having known each other for about nine years through many trials and tribulations, we have settled into a Calvin/Hobbesian friendship as near to family as one can be without blood.  We also both suffer from a certain kind of madness and take a special glee in it, and thus are both the kind of people to go backpacking for 5 months.  While we will be starting at the same time down in Campo, California and her parents are our resupply coordinators, our 10 inch difference in height and rather different personalities means we will be hiking in tandem rather than together on the PCT.  She has a very entertaining <a href=\"http://ameliorator.blogspot.com\">blog</a> that you should totally check it out.</p><p><strong>OK, what\'s all this knee talk about?</strong></p><p>In August 2011, I was leading a trip up near Mt. Adams and while jumping down from a ledge my right patella/kneecap slammed into a small rock outcropping.  Took out a sizable chunk of skin and made the next two days of traveling rather painful.  Back in town, I got an X-ray just to confirm there was nothing broken and got fitted with a leg brace to wear for 10 days.  It improved but was still a bit painful.  A month later, I reinjured it, which lead to me seeing an orthopedic surgeon and dropping out of the pre-medicine program I was enrolled in.  Physical therapy went well but two and a half months in, it took a severe turn for the worse.  No idea why, but it is possible the cartilage was still loosely attached somewhere and finally tore completely.  That led to arthroscopic surgery that discovered a severe defect in my articular cartilage and cracks throughout.  They cleaned up what they could, but it was not the result they were hoping for.  What followed was six months of slow, difficult physical therapy just to get back to walking in a straight line and pedaling up hills on my bike.</p><p>Basically a mess with torn ligament/tendon, impinged fat pad, and the damaged cartilage.  And so, after eight years of soccer, decades of trail running, and a lifetime spent outdoors I got a bum knee all because I jumped and my knee was half an inch from being in the clear.  But, I have kept on exercising and pushing it so that I have done hour long trail runs, snowshoed into a remote fire tower, and been training with a 30 pound backpack on 10-12 mile hikes.  The knee will never be 100% again and it might not handle the PCT mileage, but I have prepared it as best I can.</p><p><strong>Are you excited?!?!</strong><br></p><p>Not so much excited as I am curious. Very very curious. Curious to know if my knee will hold up. Curious to know how my gear will work. Curious to know who I will meet on the trail. Curious to see how the trail changes me. It\'s an adventure. Exploring, hiking, trying new things, seeing new locations, meeting new people.  Makes me very curious to see how it all turns out.<br></p><p><strong>What will you do when you are done?</strong></p><p>This question amuses me.  I just spent four months planning a five month backpacking trip, which I have not even started, and you already want to know what I will do next?  At this point, I am waiting to see how the first month of this trip goes. Only after that will I really get a sense how the rest of my year will shape up.  I do have ideas though!  The <a href=\"http://www.outdoors.org\">Appalachian Mountain Club</a> has <a href=\"http://www.outdoors.org/publications/outdoors/2007/amc-winter-caretakers.cfm\">winter caretakers</a> for their huts in the White Mountains, and I have always wanted to do that.  I also just finished up the recertification process for being a Wilderness EMT and would not mind becoming an instructor for the <a href=\"http://www.nols.edu/wmi/\">NOLS Wilderness Medicine Institute</a>.  And, there is quite a bit of technology and code that I would not mind learning and building with to the point of perhaps taking a full time, 9to5 gig with a development firm.</p>', '2013-04-12 05:15:21', '2015-11-10 06:47:11', 'a1cabce1-7612-4c9a-abc7-37c1cf896faa'),
 ('13', '30', 'en_us', 'Gear List', '<p>\r\n	Below is my current gear list for the trail with everything in my pack measured with a baking scale for accuracy.  This is actually copied over from an even more detailed spreadsheet I created, so hopefully I got it all down correctly.  A little OCD?  Nah...</p><p>\r\n	<img src=\"http://shapelesschaos.com/assets/uploads/Gear.png\" style=\"width:640px;height:auto;\"></p><p>\r\n	My base pack weight, which is considered what is in your pack \r\n	<strong>not</strong> including consumables like food, water, and fuel, is right at 15 pounds. I also included links to the product\'s website, Amazon, and REI to help readers get a range of information and reviews.  That being said, I shopped around and found quite a number of discounts from the likes of <a href=\"http://www.geartrade.com\">GearTrade</a>, <a href=\"http://backcountry.com\">Backcountry.com</a>, <a href=\"http://ebay.com\">eBay</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.sierratradingpost.com\">Sierra Trading Post</a>.  Thus, the prices listed at those sites will likely not match my \"purchased cost\" for each item.</p><p>\r\n	Despite having quite a plethora of gear already, unfortunately most of it is meant for activities like mountaineering and snow camping.  Not exactly lightweight.  So, I bit the bullet and bought new, ultralight versions of a shelter, sleeping bag/pad, and pack for a rather hefty cost of $995.  Yet, by buying those four items instead of using what I already owned, I reduced my base pack weight by over five pounds.  Considering the time and distance, I felt that was a worthwhile investment. After the big four, my next four largest purchases were a JetBoil Sol Titanium stove, a solar charger, and my hiking shirt and pants.</p><p>\r\n	JetBoil Sol Titanium.  While it seems the hip/cool ultralight PCT backpacker uses an \r\n	<a href=\"http://jwbasecamp.com/Articles/SuperCat/\">alcohol stove</a>, I simply could not get excited about using one. I know that when I cook while backpacking, I am usually about one evolutionary leap away from caveman and want my food <em><strong>now</strong></em>. Also did not like having to concern myself with alcohol measuring, the lack of simmering, and instability.  This new JetBoil boils 2 cups of water in about a minute, which is the perfect amount of water for most of my dinners, while a fuel cannister should last around two weeks.  Doubt I will regret this decision.</p><p>\r\n	Solar Charger. We are in the age of technology. Our smartphones are camera, GPS, web browser, app platform, and phone all in one.  The sCharger-5 Solar Charger is hopefully going to help me keep my iPhone powered. It was highly recommended by a few PCT hikers last year and my initial tests have shown it to be quite the little power delivery device when there is full sun.</p><p>\r\n	Hiking Shirt and Bottom.  I am not sure where I initially heard about \r\n	<a href=\"http://www.railriders.com\">RailRiders</a>, but the more I read the more it looked like their clothes would be ideal for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  Lightweight, ventilated, quick drying, and long lasting.  One of my more blind faith gear choices, but sometimes you need to rely on a good feeling and hope it turns out to be right.</p><p>\r\n	Everything else is reasonably standard or self explanatory.  I am sure with more money\r\n	<em>,</em> research<em>, and</em> sacrificing of comfort, I could reduce my base weight another 3 pounds and perhaps even have found cheaper items.  But, for now I am reasonably content with my choices.  We shall see how foolish I truly am once on the trail.</p>\r\n<table cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\">\r\n<caption>Pack

 ('15', '32', 'en_us', 'Certifiable', '<p>\r\n	In mid-February, I spent two weeks in Central Oregon taking a Wilderness First Responder (WFR) course offered by NOLS&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nols.edu/wmi/\">Wilderness Medicine Institute</a> and sponsored by the <a href=\"http://omsi.edu\">Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI)</a>. &nbsp;Both my Oregon EMT license and National Registry EMT certification were up for renewal this year, so taking the course was an efficient way to get my continuing education credits out of the way as well as renewing the \"wilderness\" component of my Wilderness EMT. &nbsp;Not only that, but I got to spend two weeks out in the Oregon desert; clear, star-filed skies at night and beautiful views during my lunchtime hikes.</p><p>\r\n	When I returned to Port Townsend, <a href=\"http://www.ejfr.org\">East Jefferson Fire-Rescue</a> allowed me to join their current batch of EMTs in training for five weeks of lecture and skill practicals. Got to do everything from vehicle extrication at one of the local firehouses to relearning neonatal care (not so common in the backcountry, oddly). This training insured all of my <em>urban</em> EMT skills were up to snuff. &nbsp;March and April were a busy couple months as I was working full time and training/planning for the PCT too. &nbsp;But, all of the required paperwork and signatures were sent off a few weeks ago so I am not yet recertified but I am certifiable, again.</p><p>\r\n	With all of this training, knowledge, and experience building a lightweight first aid kit for a 2,600+ mile hike is a Herculean battle between two opposing desires. &nbsp;How much weight is too much vs. what items are worth the weight given my skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I led outdoor trips, most organization-provided first aid kits that were around 5 pounds and were one lawyer recommendation away from containing an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_external_defibrillator\">AED</a>. &nbsp;On my own backpacking trips I usually have a first aid kit between a pound to a pound and a half that is meant to prevent an uncomfortable or problematic situation from becoming a <em>really </em>bad day.</p><p>\r\n	Amelia commented when she saw my completed kit that I built this PCT first aid kit not for me but for everyone else on the trail, despite the fact that I do not particularly like most people and head into the wilderness to escape civilization. I am funny like that.</p><p>\r\n	Since the PCT crosses many towns, roads, and campsites, there will be both urban and wilderness medical situations possible. &nbsp;The balance I tried to strike was between light and capable of handling the most likely scenarios, while not regretting what I could have carried but did not for weight reasons. &nbsp;Tough. &nbsp;And like all things, I will likely adjust it on the way.</p><p>\r\n	The kit includes the following:&nbsp;Ace bandage, gauze roll, athletic tape, NSAID pain relievers, gloves + CPR face shield, moleskin, tweezers, pins, Benadryl, backup water purification tablets, QuikClot, triangle bandage, SecondSkin blister pads, bandaids, gauze pads. All for only <strong>9.5 oz</strong> total, which is about the weight of 1.2 cups of water. &nbsp;</p><p>\r\n	<img src=\"http://shapelesschaos.com/assets/uploads/first_aid_kit.png\" style=\"width:640px;height:auto;\"></p><p>\r\n	The majority of the what I have treated in the backcountry are blisters and musculoskeletal injuries &nbsp;There have been a few decent bleeds and cuts but nothing that a bit of gauze and tape cannot handle. &nbsp;So, I went with a half dozen blister pads, enough gauze to handle a few decent bleeds, and ace bandage + triangle bandage. &nbsp;Sure I could improvise something for the ace bandage or triangle bandage, but I have yet to meet a trained professional who would not greatly prefer to have it provided. &nbsp;Tape, pain relievers, tweezers, pins, and allergy meds are all lightweight, handy, and are pretty hard to improvise. &nbsp;Ever tried to <a href=\"http://wwwchem.csustan.edu/consumer/aspirincons/aspirincons.htm\">synthesize aspirin</a> in the wilderness? Not easy, my friends.</p><p>\r\n	The gloves, CPR face shield and QuikClot are meant more for urban or semi-urban problems. &nbsp;In the back of my mind, I can just imagine hitching into town and seeing a car accident or having a respiratory or cardiac arrest at a campground. &nbsp;For their weight, they could realistically mean the difference between life and death. &nbsp;They could be the first things to go too as those scenarios seem the least likely.</p><p>\r\n	For the weight of just over a cup of water, I feel pretty good about this kit. &nbsp;Anything else I might conceivably want, I can improvise (healing power of laughter!), find on the way (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/407010/tecnu-oak-n-ivy-cleanser\">Tecnu</a>), or it would be far heavier than I would be willing to carry (oxygen tank).</p>', '2013-04-19 05:19:54', '2015-11-10 06:47:11', '63c24f96-2f88-43e1-8a3e-5f85501b7ca2'),

Prone to hours of intensive activity with single minded determinism.&nbsp; The distance from Idyllwild (Saddle Junction) to Big Bear (Highway 18) is 89.2 miles when you tack on the hike up the Devil\'s Slide trail from Idyllwild. Originally I had planned to do it in a bit over 5 days because of the elevation profile. Took me less than 4 days.</p><p>Works out to a little over 22 miles a day.&nbsp; One of those days was a 25 miler.&nbsp; That day started with a good plan of only doing 19 miles, but I reached that point around 2:30 in the afternoon.&nbsp; What do you do with yourself when your normal trail bed time is not for another 6.5 hours?&nbsp; So, I made a meal, got water, relaxed a bit, and then did six more miles to the Coon Creek Cabin Group Campground, where I spent a rather chilly night with a group of 10 other hikers in an open cabin.&nbsp; The next day was only 20 miles to the Highway 18 hitch into Big Bear, so even with a late start because of the 15 degree temperatures, I made it there by 2:30 p.m. again.</p><p>Think about that.&nbsp; You are out on a trail and you can do 20 miles irregardless of 5000-7000 foot climbs or descents before it is even 3pm. And you can easily go a day without seeing another soul, which does not help. One can only read so many books and admire so many beautiful clouds or gallant peaks before you simply want to keep on going. The trail is not getting any shorter. Keep hiking.<br></p><p>Of course, the consequence is that while you can pull off 25 mile days, you are still in your first few weeks and could easily push too hard.&nbsp; Also, you are leaving behind all those you started with or met along the way.&nbsp; I greatly enjoyed and bonded well with the group I met at Scout and Frodo\'s. Naturally, I would not mind seeing Amelia too. Even for an introvert like myself, it is really helpful to socialize a bit, have an unobtrusive conversation, even if it is just about the next day\'s challenge or how long to stop at a Trail Angel\'s rest area.</p><p>So, I reached Big Bear two days ahead of schedule.&nbsp; If I keep this pace up, I will reach Kennedy Meadows by the end of May, despite not really planning on being there until June 5th at the earliest.&nbsp; There is really no reason to rush.

 ('22', '39', 'en_us', 'The Gear Review, Part I', '<p>\r\n	Despite having rather speedy 4G access in most towns, I have been finding it extremely difficult to write anything on the iPhone. Simply is not a big enough screen with the keyboard to make writing enjoyable. One of those times when I wonder how an iPad Mini would hold up.  For the most part, I am writing these blog posts whenever I get to a town that has a library. Alas, library internet is not overly fast and all the computers are using an old version of Internet Explorer by default.  So, I have been downloading Chrome to make the whole writing situation more palatable.  That takes a while with the connection speed and then in no time my time is up.  Thus, these entries are written quickly and with very little proof reading.  Anyhoo...here are a few updates regarding the gear I have been using.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Tarptent Contrail.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	With such a lightweight and seemingly easy setup, I really thought I would love this tent for my first attempts at both doing a thru-hike and going ultralight.  Alas, no.  The desert regions have had rather strong winds and at times difficult ground (too hard, too sandy). Since the tent is not freestanding, it has been extremely difficult making it robust enough to survive a night of high winds.  At Whitewater Creek, when the front containing a thunderstorm started coming in, my tent collapsed twice, despite staking it AND using a copious amount of rocks to reinforce the stakes.  When you stop wanting to set up your tent at all and just cowboy camp every night, that is a problem. So, I threw in the towel and have ordered a new tent, Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1, from REI.  It is a bit heavier, but it is freestanding and has been praised by other hikers on the trail.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Brooks Cascadia 8 Shoes.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Love these shoes.  When I was testing shoes prior to the hiker, I always seemed to get sore feet after 8 or 10 miles. Not with these.  I have done a 28 mile day in the desert heat and my feet were not sore afterwards. They may not be able to survive as much punishment as more dedicated hiking shoes though.  Around mile 340, I noticed that the tread was loose and there were tiny holes where the end of my pinky toe ends.  Thankfully, at Cajon Junction, a fellow hiker, Dingo, rented a car and we took a trip to REI (two hour trip because of a brush fire that closed the interstate and caused a massive traffic snarl).\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	REI, to their credit, replaced the shoes but with a stern look and voice informing me that these shoes were not meant for this manner of activity.  We shall see if this pair survives the next 300-500 miles or if the PCT abuses it too much.  Even if I have to replace them every 350 miles, I think I will stick with them, they are simply too light and comfortable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Gossamer Gear Mariposa Backpack</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Solid.  Light, perfect size, and so far standing up to the abuse.  I have put one hole into its big mesh pocket, but that was a sharp trekking pole.  One of the hip pouch zippers seems to be coming loose, but I think I can fix that up without any problem.  The removal sit pad is genius.  I had my doubts, but I use it multiple times a day.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>ZPacks 900 Fill Power Down, 20 degree Sleeping Bag.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This one is tough. While up at Coon Creek Cabin, at over 8000 feet, the temperature dropped to at least 15 degrees Fahrenheit. I was perfectly cozy in this bag with my long underwear on and a hat.  However, on those nights when the desert only cools to a balmy 58 degrees Fahrenheit, this bag is much much too warm.  After hiking 20+ miles and eating a solid dinner, my legs seem to radiate ungodly amounts of heat.  I have taken to putting on my sleeping clothes and using the sleeping bag as a blanket only for my top.  This is not really the fault of the bag, but I do miss having a full length zipper so I can better free my legs to the night air while keeping my torso comfortable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Sawyer Squeeze Water Filter.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	This filter works well.  It works really well. Having seen how much people love the inline Sawyer filter for their CamelBaks is having me contemplating a switch.  It only takes probably 5-7 minutes to make all the water I will need for a long stretch, but it is not as convenient as simply being able to empty the water into your hydration bladder and go.  No worries, virtually no effort.  Hard to not desire that a bit.  The REI we went to from Cajon Junction did not have the inline adapter in stock, but if I see it later on I might impulse buy it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>KEEN Socks.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	More details about this will come a bit later.  The Smartwool socks I started with did not survive much past two weeks; holes in the heels. The KEEN socks arrived 10 days in and 16 days in.  They seem to be surviving, but thinning a bit in the heels and balls of my feet.  We shall see how they survive the next two weeks.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Everything Else.</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Those are the major items.  Will have more likely later, but otherwise by gear is living up perfectly to my expectations.  Two things I seem to be constantly low on is duct tape and blister bandaids.  Even with airing out of my feet a few times a day and changing into dry (and maybe recently rinsed) socks, I seem to develop a hot spot or blister every few days.  My feet are slowly recovering/thickening but the desert is a harsh mistress.\r\n</p>', '2013-05-14 21:33:27', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'fd9d100b-194b-4097-9cca-63ee58873008'),
 ('25', '42', 'en_us', 'The Body Review, Part I', '<p>When I started this trip, I had very little confidence that I would finish it. &nbsp;Honestly, when I was boarding the flight from Bellingham to San Diego, I admitted I thought I would be back within the week. Might be surprising to hear that if you understand how much planning and preparation when into this five month backpacking trip. &nbsp;With my knees and ankles all having been well used and abused for the past 30+ years, I thought it unlikely they would stand up to an average of 20 miles a day, for days upon days upon days, especially with not enough calories, water, or rest.</p><p>And yet, here we are. &nbsp;Over three weeks in and fast approaching an entire month on the trail. &nbsp;Statistically this means I am extremely likely to finish the entire Pacific Crest Trail this year. &nbsp;Blows my mind a bit. Not only that, I seem to be doing significantly better health-wise than the average thru-hiker. &nbsp;Still, there have been issues.</p><p>My right knee (the one that had surgery last year and required 6 months of physical therapy just to get me on a bike again) has exceeded every expectation. There was a little soreness initially and it will never quite bend smoothly again thanks to the defect in my cartilage and the tendon scar tissue, but the damn thing has never had a single bad day. &nbsp;Let us hope this continues.</p><p>My left knee had an elastic knee brace on it for the first two weeks because I strained it the week before starting the trail while moving out of the apartment. However, that brace came off completely a few days ago and it survived without pain for over 50 miles. &nbsp;Yesterday it developed a tiny amount of pain again, so I think the brace will go back on for the next couple weeks with occasional breaks. &nbsp;Still, so far so good.</p><p>The legs are otherwise fine. &nbsp;Every thru-hiker has what we call the \"hiker walk\" in the first week. &nbsp;Sort of a cowboy stance hobble and the inability to walk in a straight line without a pack on. &nbsp;Your body is adjusting to the miles and the muscles are not pleased with the unending toil. &nbsp;Eventually they adapt and you only have that hobble after really hard days.</p><p>The feet. &nbsp;I have only met a single hiker who has not had foot issues. &nbsp;There was a girl with 15 blisters, mostly between her toes. &nbsp;Mudd had a blister about three inches long straight down the ball of his foot to his arch. &nbsp;It looked horrific and when he drained it, he could not walk another mile. &nbsp;But my feet are doing reasonably well. &nbsp;One blister the first week that was at the crease of the big toe and a few decent ones on my heels since then. &nbsp;Nothing that has not been manageable with a bit of duct tape and some blister pads. &nbsp;I can definitely see that my skin is becoming thicker and tougher with the miles. &nbsp;If I continue treating them well (change socks, air feet, protect hot spots), I am hoping in another couple weeks hot spots and blisters will be a memory.</p><p>Otherwise, the body seems healthy. &nbsp;Definitely have lost a bit of weight. &nbsp;I suspect in the 5-7 pounds range. &nbsp;Muscles in my chest are getting little to no exercise, so my skinny thru-hiker physique is coming along splendidly. &nbsp;Long, muscular hiking legs and strong shoulders from the pack and poles. &nbsp; Will likely be rubbish at biking, climbing, and swimming when I finish though. &nbsp;Sacrifices must be made in the name of adventure.</p>\r\n', '2013-05-15 19:23:30', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'dfa84059-86bb-461e-88c1-4cc72c69c16b'),

It really is heaven for people who have just hiked through a hundred miles of hot desert full of <a href=\"http://us.yhs4.search.yahoo.com/r/_ylt=A0oGdMk6kJlRqWQAIYUPxQt.;_ylu=X3oDMTByZWgwN285BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA3NrMQR2dGlkAw--/SIG=12agnvsaa/EXP=1369047226/**http%3a//www.pcta.org/2013/poodle-dog-bush-warning-8891/\">poodle dog bush</a>, rattlesnakes, sweaty ascents, and knee busting descents.</p><p>I timed it so I arrived here this morning around 9:30 a.m. giving me ample time to shower, sit around and relax while my laundry was being done, and generally just be a lazy bum reading a book. Then I biked into Agua Dulce for lunch and an investigation of the shopping opportunities for food. &nbsp;Thanks to the Hiker Heaven\'s hiker box and a care package from Mrs. MJ Lohrenz, I am pretty well set for breakfast already. &nbsp;And since I yogi\'ed dinner last night, I still have two dinners in my food bag. &nbsp;Pretty easy and cheap resupply here.</p><p>After that, I moseyed back to Hiker\'s Heaven to read a bit more and made plans to have pizza with a group of fellow hikers. Completely stuffed right now after splitting a 14\" veggie pizza with No. 2. &nbsp;Which is good since after showering I weighed myself and it seems I am down to a lovely 172 pounds. &nbsp;Of course, I started at 181 pounds, so I can only assume I was overweight when I started. Yup. That must be it.</p><p>This entry is sort of rambling. &nbsp;But, my overall point is that this seems to be the pattern to life on the trail. Days of hard miles that can really kick your ass, exhaust you, and make you question why a sane person would be out here doing this...and then a day in a town or at a trail angel\'s abode where you recover and indulge in every single tempting morsel you can find. &nbsp;Rinse, repeat, keep on hiking.</p>\r\n', '2013-05-20 02:55:50', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'de697b78-816f-4123-86f9-8586cd3a9d83'),
 ('28', '45', 'en_us', 'What do you think about while hiking?', '<p>A somewhat common belief about long distance hiking is that you will have plenty of time to think. Figure out your troubles, work through problems, and contemplate deep thoughts. &nbsp;As I have a tedious tendency to obsessively think as it is, I think there was a reasonable belief that an abundance of trail thinking would drive me a bit over the edge.</p><p>Shockingly this has not been the case. &nbsp;In fact, thinking while hiking has been rather difficult. Despite the trail being graded for horses and there being an organization behind its upkeep, traipsing along it requires a certain amount of concentration. &nbsp;Rocks, roots, cliff edges, poison oak, poodle dog bush, stream crossings, et cetera. &nbsp;Throw in a pack that is averaging 28 pounds, two hiking poles to manage, and days of 20+ miles...and you have a recipe for a consistent need to focus.</p><p>At the end of the day you are usually so tired, you simply want food, bed, and maybe a bit of relaxation, which for hikers seems to be either smoking, drinking, TV watching, or for a select few it is reading a book. &nbsp;I just finished my fifth book and have spent an entire town afternoon in the library, so I think we know what camp I belong to.</p><p>Yet, saying all that, I <i>have </i>had time to think. Had an entire afternoon where I had Taylor Swift\'s \"22\" in my head on repeat (damn catchy song). &nbsp;Spent an hour outside the grocery store in Wrightwood talking to a local pediatrician about the trail, my wavering desire to pursue some manner of career in medicine, and his own experience combined with that of two of his children (end all: he strongly encouraged me to go back and finish pre-med).</p><p>Also have thought quite a bit about what I want out of the rest of my life. Reviewing in my head what I have been most proud of in my life, what I regret the most, the principles I still hold, and how it all might fit together into at least a direction, if not a firm goal.</p><p>Nothing firm yet, but it has been interesting to see what has come to light. &nbsp;A regret I did not realize was so potent has reared its head and a principle I used to strongly hold to has lost quite a bit of its steam. &nbsp;And I am not even past the one month of hiking mark. &nbsp;Could be fun seeing what else slides/pops/wiggles into my consciousness on the trail.</p>\r\n', '2013-05-20 04:04:42', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', '33dc56bc-3ed5-4569-be1e-62ab480aa8f2'),
 ('29', '46', 'en_us', 'Bad Days', '<p><em>You know what they say.<br>Some things in life are bad,<br>They can really make you mad.<br>Other things just make you swear and curse.<br>When you\'re chewing on life\'s gristle,<br>Don\'t grumble, give a whistle!<br>And this\'ll help things turn out for the best...</em></p><p>That\'s a lie, Mr. Idle.  A damn damn dirty lie.  </p><p>Bad days happen on the trail, there is no way around it.  And, it is incredible how just one slip in judgment or a seemingly minuscule event can cause an otherwise normal day to tailspin into a fantastically wretched day. I was extremely lucky in that my first four weeks on the trail I only had one bad day. Too much sun, an unsettled stomach, and a poor night\'s sleep sapped my energy so that I felt thrashed from the moment I woke up. The entire day consisted in nothing but forcing myself to take steps and wishing for it to be over.</p><p>This last week had three bad days in quick succession.  It all started after Agua Dulce.  Epsom salt foot baths were available at Hiker Heaven and since my heel calluses seemed a bit overgrown, I indulged in one to soften them up a bit (such a horrible idea in retrospect).  Foolishly, I never washed my feet off afterward to clear off the salt.  The next day, after a poor night of sleep, I started off at 5 a.m. to beat the heat as the trail started with about five miles of road walking.  By the time I got back on a proper trail, my feet had lost a couple layers of skin in key places.  That was just the beginning.</p><p>Even with clean socks, blister pads, and duct tape the hot spots got worse, especially on my heels.  There was little shade once the sun rose and my whole body slowly roasted until I stumbled into the fire station just up from the Anderson\'s (trail angels at Casa de Luna).  I was definitely not the only hiker who was suffering from foot problems  either, thanks to the heat baking both the ground and our bodies.  Five of the six hikers I met while resting at the fire station reported that their feet had become messed up over the course of the day.</p><p>Still, after resting for three or four hours and cleaning all feet and socks, I continued on to the next water cache.  That was a bit of foolish of me.  I did not need to continue on and my feet could have used a longer recovery period.  But it was early still.  I wanted to stick with and camp with people I knew.  So, I kept on going.  ::sigh::</p><p>By the time I camped my feet had graduated from possibly problematic to a complete mess.  I had also lost my brand new book (left behind during a break), cut my hand while getting off trail for a bathroom break, and was all around miserable from mile dehydration and miles of constant descent.  If a genie had appeared and offered to whisk me back to my old, lovely apartment in Port Townsend with a fresh episode of Doctor Who waiting...doubt I would have said no.</p><p>To make a long story short, despite trying to baby my feet and not push too hard, I had a limited supply of food and a desert to cross until my next resupply.  The next few days of hiking were not pleasant at all, especially since I forgot my second pair of socks drying on a fence and my backup socks were given to a desperate friend a few days before. Feeling the searing hot pain of a blister popping? One of the most demoralizing experiences a hiker can feel.  Combine it with the usual trail trials and every additional minor problem just compounded my mental and physical fatigue.  Only will power kept me from just collapsing in a heap yesterday.</p><p>All of which reinforces the fact that thru-hikers are a stubborn lot.  It takes a special combination of foolishness, insanity, and mental resiliency to willfully subject your body and mind to a thru-hike. Yet, hikers do have ways of responding to the stress and handling those really bad days.  </p><p>I have seen an older gentleman on a rather steep bit of remote trail with hardly a rock to sit on calling his wife just to hear a kind voice during a particularly difficult stretch.  A hiker couple just barely leaning into each other during a snack break to feel that small bit of support.  Hiker camaraderie and bitching sessions are quite common at the end of the day and during long breaks.  Vacant stares into the distance and crying happen too.  During the Mojave desert crossing at one point three of just dead dropped our packs, flopped on the ground, and did not say anything for two or three minutes while we ate food and collected ourselves.</p><p>My primary way of dealing with the grind is sharing my experiences and photos on Twitter and Facebook almost daily.  The desert is photogenic and heart-stopping beautiful at times, despite the heat.  And a Don Quixote reference while crossing a wind turbine farm in the early morning has most definitely not gone unused.  That bit of humor and sharing with friends around the world is what kept me going during those bad days.  And remembering the fact that I genuinely enjoy sharing the outdoors with other people is not a bad thought either.</p>', '2013-05-26 02:35:49', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'c6994457-df14-4841-8646-5578cde32c8f'),
 ('30', '47', 'en_us', 'What do you miss most, being on the trail?', '<p>Thinking about this question, what first comes to mind is what I do not miss. The noise of civilization comes to mind first.  I have taken longish backcountry trips before and when I returned to Portland, the cars whizzing by on 39th Avenue had me on edge for over a week before I acclimated to city life again.  Now after being on the PCT for over a month, being in something as simple as a remote town with a small grocery store with all of the music, talking, and the noise that humans create is slightly unsettling.</p><p>Showers and beds are odd now too. I am staying with the <a href=\"http://boyinks4adventure.com/\">Boyink </a>family this weekend and even though I could easily sleep in their RV, I feel far more comfortable sleeping outside, under the stars, with a bit of wind.  And, I feel no compulsion to take a shower every day or even every other day.  I am hardly getting dirty sitting around eating, talking, and reading books.  Why would I need to shower?  Showers are now meant for when you need to wash off the grime after days on the trail and be presentable.</p><p>I definitely daydream about reading material and food on the trail.  The ability to eat the wide assortment of foods in an American grocery store is truly a wonder when you think about it.  Ice cream, cinnamon rolls, pumpkin pie, stir fry, salads, et cetera.  All sound really good when I get into town.  And, I have now finished seven books on this trip. Every town stop has me tossing one book into the Hiker Box and looking for a new one (or two) for the next section.</p><p>The cool weather of the Pacific Northwest combined with my old, glorious apartment has been on my mind during the bad days too.  While crossing the Mojave desert, I had at least a litre and a half of water throughout the night and still woke up dehydrated.  The hot, arid weather does not agree with me. Being able to watch a windy, wet storm go on outside while watching Doctor Who and eating pie often sounds like bliss.</p><p>What I really miss most though, is friendly, relaxed company.  The trail is stressful. It is all too often empty and even a bit lonely.  There have been a handful of days when I see no one until the end of the day and at least a third of my nights have been spent camping alone.  Despite all of my introverted and asocial tendencies, I do crave human companionship on a semi-regular basis. Part of this trip\'s learning experience is being forced to examine how isolated I have made my non-trail daily life and how going further down that path is unenjoyable in the long term.</p><p>The examination of how to balance my need to be alone, do challenging adventures, and my desire for human company is ongoing.  Many more months to think about it.</p><p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>OK, so let\'s get one thing straight. While I do not really miss showers on a daily basis, after five or six days of hiking I greatly enjoy washing the grime off both myself and my clothes.</p>', '2013-05-26 19:18:15', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', '3120154b-bc85-4b44-821f-dbc1994d179f'),
 ('31', '48', 'en_us', 'Connection Not Found', '<p>\r\n	    Been quite a long while since I posted a blog entry.  While the trail has challenges when it comes to water and food, it is nothing compared to the inability to reliably connect to the internet.  First World Problems, I know.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    I am currently in Mammoth Lakes, California sharing a condo with nine other hikers for a couple days. We just exited the High Sierras and are only two days away from Tuolumne Meadows (and Yosemite).  The past few weeks has been a collection of <em>exhausting</em> 6-7 day trips between resupply points.  Tehachapi to Kennedy Meadows to Independence to Mammoth.  For that entire time, I probably had cell service for only four days and even then it was not always reliable.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    Kennedy Meadows had an internet \"cafe\", which was really no more than a few poorly working Dell computers in a trailer connected via satellite.  It was fine for checking email, but I lost two separate blog entries when the connection was lost or the computer ceased to function.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    Independence was a teeny tiny little town, and we hitched to Bishop as soon as we got a Subway sandwich and Amelia\'s packages from the post office.  The Bishop library had computers but they were locked down and were using an ancient version of Internet Explorer that even Gmail did not support.  No chance to upgrade, so I abandoned my quest and decided to wait another week.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    So, here we are nearly a month later.  Still got a bit more of Sierras to go, but Amelia\'s parents are meeting us at Tuolumne Meadows and my computer will be there.  Photos!  Videos! Blog Entries! But only if we find good wi-fi.

 ('32', '49', 'en_us', 'Hike Your Own Hike - Purism', '<p>\r\n	     The phrase \"Hike Your Own Hike\" is thrown around regularly by hikers as a reflexive catchphrase meant to suggest that everyone\'s hike is their own and despite any differences we may have between our approaches to hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, my way does not affect you and your way does not affect me. Not so subtly, it is also used by hikers to disregard the opinions and approaches of others.  Sort of a low key \"fuck you\" when there is a strong disagreement but a desire to avoid conflict.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    While I would not consider myself a PCT purist, where detours are not allowed and every single mile of the the trail must be covered by my footsteps, I am troubled by people who are calling themselves thru-hikers when they are most assuredly not by any definition I can accept.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    The reason this is on my mind so much (and worth a blog entry) is because during the second week, multiple hikers skipped straight from Paradise Cafe to Idylwild.  One of my favorite sections of the early trail and they skipped all 28 miles of it.  Not because they were injured but simply because they heard it was difficult and/or were behind schedule because of a slow start.   And yet, they still referred to themselves as thru-hikers.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    And this has continued for the entirety of the trail.  People skipped all the way from Walker Pass to Kennedy Meadows (50+ miles) because they were exhausted from the desert and wanted a long, comfortable break before entering the Sierras.  I understand that exhaustion, believe me I do, but once you start skipping huge sections like that you are no longer a thru-hiker in my book.  Being a thru-hiker to me means experiencing every bit of the Pacific Crest Trail: the highs, the lows, the joys, the challenges, the crummy weather, the gorgeous views.  All of it.   Saying you thru-hiked the Pacific Crest Trail means something very significant to me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	  Slack packing.  I am still on the fence about this. This is when a hiker gets dropped off at a road with a super light pack, usually only containing food and water, and they quickly hike to another road where they are picked up again.  Typically, they then go back to a town or campsite for the night.  So, they are not really backpacking so much as day hiking sections of the trail.  People have been doing this from the beginning and while they are technically hiking the trail, it still makes me a bit uneasy.  I suspect this is no so much a foul of thru-hiking as me having a belief that the trail should always be \"backpacked\" and not just \"hiked\".  Personal preference, especially when you consider all the ways of resupplying, going ultralight, and having friends/family support you.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	  Which leads me to my own definition of thru-hiking and how I, myself, <em>intend</em> to hike the entirety of the Pacific Crest Trail.  Quite simply, all of my footsteps have to connect from the Southern Terminus to the Northern Terminus of the PCT.   I can be picked up by a vehicle but I have to be dropped off at the same spot when I return to the trail.  My backpack will always be with me too. If thru-hiking the Pacific Crest Trail is my entire life than it should be along for the entire time.  The one exception I will allow is for official detours (fire, poodle dog).  Safety, sanity, and responsible behavior take priority.\r\n</p>', '2013-06-26 00:57:08', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', '3ec8c67b-4fe9-4350-9d79-3a270744f831'),
 ('59', '105', 'en_us', 'Northern California, Oregon, and Portland', '<p>\r\n	    Two months!  I have not posted in two months! Not since Tuolumne Meadows! And now I am sitting at my friend Dave\'s house in Portland, where I will be leading a backpacking trip for Reed College starting tomorrow morning.  Yes, that\'s right, I got off the Pacific Crest Trail to lead a backpacking trip.  Everyone seems to find that amusing.  The timing just worked out so perfectly and I enjoy leading Reedies into the wilderness so much that it was awfully hard to say no.  Also, the money I will make by leading nine freshmen and two upperclassmen student leaders into the Mt. Adams Wilderness will pay for all of my resupplies in Washington.  Nice!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    So, the last two months were intense and long. Goodall and I made it through the Sierras tired but mostly intact.  Her parents met us again at Sonora Pass and gave us a tasty dinner and took the unwieldy bear canisters away (far far away).  Then, we entered what must have been the birthplace of the primal mosquitos, as they were there both in force and ferocity.  Entire flocks hunted us for days.  Headnets and DEET not optional.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	   Finally, we entered Northern California where we enjoyed many days of temperatures near 100 degrees Fahrenheit and plenty of volcanic rocks through old, shadeless burn areas. Northern California had more than its fair share of unpleasant days. Upon finishing the 30+ dry stretch that is Hat Creek Rim, I remember looking at two fellow hikers, Lotus and Hermes, and we all just looked spent. Shortly after, near Burney Falls, I got my worst blister of the entire trip.  The intense heat combined with volcanic rock caused a large blister to form <em style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\">underneath</em> the callous on the ball of my left foot.  Was hardly able to walk for two days.  And then my iPhone got stolen while at Castella, which had me psychologically break down for an hour (maps, notes, music, photos, videos...buh-bye) and then heading into Mt. Shasta, where I charmed my way into getting a brand new phone that afternoon and at a reduced cost.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	   There were really good days too though.  In Sierra City, nearly everyone took at least one zero and I got to catch up with many old hiking friends.  In Seiad City, Goodall and I spent the night with two Reed alums who lived just down the road in Happy Valley; enjoyed a quiet night with showers, laundry, a home cooked meal, and comfy beds.  And let\'s not forget that sunset near Mt. Shasta where the sky came alive with mind bogglingly layers of clouds and color.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	   Near the Oregon border, we had our first taste of forest fires and their smoke.  A lightning storm a few days prior had started at least four fires in Oregon and their smoke drifted down into California. During the long climb out of Seiad Valley, you could hardly see the hillside a couple hundred meters across from you. Once in Oregon, Ashland and Medford had such bad smoke that the outdoor plays were canceled.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	   Near Crater Lake, I got my first taste of Oregon weather schizophrenia.  Not sure what it is, but whenever I am on the Pacific Crest Trail during August in Oregon, I always seem to have first forest fires and then chilling rain.  Naturally, I had not checked the weather before leaving Ashland and had forwarded my rain pants on.  Thankfully I kept my Smartwool beanie as there were a couple wet days followed by chilly nights.  Yet, somehow, we carried on.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	   Right around the Three Sisters Wilderness, Oregon became absolutely gorgeous.  Cookie and I dry camped shortly before Obsidian Creek and enjoyed a lovely sunset and sunrise to the west of Middle Sister. Sadly, the next day had us hiking through at least five miles total of volcanic rock near McKenzie Pass followed by a long, will-sucking burn area.  I am ever so glad I changed my plans and took a night off in Sisters.  Gave me a chance to catch up with a former coworker, eat good food, and just relax before the final push to Timberline Lodge.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 Thanks to the Burney Falls Blister (say that three times fast), I was a couple days behind schedule in getting to Ashland.  Originally my plan was to head off into Portland from Cascade Locks on the 21st.  No way I was going to make that without risking an injury. So, since I was mostly hiking alone through Oregon, I was able to pull off a half dozen 30s and get to Timberline Lodge on the afternoon of the 20th.  And that is where Dave, De\'Mel, and Brian joined me for a tall glass of stout, a joyful ride back to Portland, dinner at Nicolas, and a night of Scotch tasting.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	For the following night Dave and I had organized a pie party, where I ate savory and sweet pies of numerous varieties while showing photos from the trip on the TV and talking myself a bit hoarse.  While at time a social malcontent with introvert tendencies, I loved seeing all of my Portland friends for the night.  Felt good. Joyful, even.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Which catches us up to today.  All of the gear is ready and in about an hour I will meet the nine freshmen that I will be taking out starting tomorrow morning.  Relatively easy trip with no more than 6 miles between camps but it does seem like we will have cool temperatures with a chance of rain.  Oh, Pacific Northwest, you so crazy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Upon my return I will take at least one more day in Portland, if not two, and organize my resupply, see a few more people, and relax.  And then back up to Timberline Lodge for four more weeks of hiking up to the Canadian border.  Woo hoo!\r\n</p>', '2013-08-23 17:25:37', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'ff07154f-c5dd-4e60-9b6a-9ba3f2900d4c'),
 ('60', '106', 'en_us', 'Almost There', '<p>\r\n	Sitting in a hotel room in Skykomish, Washington waiting for the cafe downstairs to open to have my last, civilized breakfast before finishing the last 187 miles of the trail.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Yup, that is all that is left. A mere 187 miles. Granted, we are all pretty well burned out on hiking at this point, so these last eight days or so feel like quite the exhausting hurdle.  Does not especially help that the distance as the crow flies is <strong>substantially</strong> less than the distance we are hiking thanks to copious amounts of up and down. I particularly enjoyed Hermes/Luke\'s <a href=\"http://beckyandlukehikethepct.wordpress.com/2013/09/14/mountains-beyond-mountains/\">description</a> of it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	But, it just over a week I will be a true thru-hiker. All of my steps have connected and I can walk proud. Or pass out on a couch proud, which seems slightly more likely for that first week back.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	While I would not say I am apprehensive or unsettled about returning to civilization and no longer hiking, I cannot say it fills me with joy or elation. Part of me is not ready to go back. The trail has a simplicity and authenticity about it. Your days are spent focusing on getting the miles done, feeding yourself, resting, recovering, and finding the will power to do it all again the next day. No doubt it is monotonous, even with the glorious terrain and immense ecosystems we have crossed.  And yet, for these past five months, it was a purer life.  Whenever the complications of the frontcountry (play on backcountry, you see) intruded it was often unpleasant and rude.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	Return we must though. I have already had a phone interview for a job with the Appalachian Mountain Club in New Hampshire for this autumn/winter and I am intending to return to school next summer (Organic Chemistry! Woo!) with the goal of finishing my pre-medicine prerequisites.  Part of me is going to be rather wistful these next few months.  Looking out the window of some warm home or building, daydreaming about my time on the trail.\r\n</p>', '2013-09-15 15:06:40', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', '503022f1-a692-4013-847c-18c3e07268fb'),

 ('65', '111', 'en_us', 'Officially a Thru-Hiker', '<p>\r\n	Last Monday morning (September 23rd, 2013), I crossed the Canadian border and officially became a Pacific Crest Trail thru-hiker five months and one day after starting from the Mexican border. After a quick photo in the cold rain and a signing of the register hidden in Monument 78, I promptly continued on hiking an additional eight miles to the road nearing Manning Park where Goodall\'s parents whisked us away to a quick shower with clean clothes, a delicious meal, and a four hour ride back across the border (via roads this time) and home to Whidbey Island.</p><p>\r\n	Not exactly the smooth cruise to the finish we were expecting. In fact, it was the most difficult and dangerous part of the entire trip.  Started with a raging thunderstorm the first night out of Steven\'s Pass followed by three days of being constantly soaked in freezing rain and staying borderline hypothermic. The day we hiked into High Bridge for the bus into Stehekin, we had a surprisingly dry and warm day.  After a night at the lodge, we headed out for a lovely autumn scented day and camped above Rainy Pass. Next morning, the freezing rain returned and for the next two days the weather cycled between cold, rain, and snow while we crossed multiple washouts on ridges; some of which were 15\' deep and required climbing up and down loose, slick rock. Our last night on the trail, we got three inches of snow and tracked the last six miles to the monument through puddles of freezing water.</p><p>\r\n	But we made it. And just in time. Here we are only about five days later and the Pacific Northwest is getting hammered with another winter storm.  1-2 feet of snow and high winds are forecasted for that last section. Most hikers still on the trail are quitting or buckling down for a few days. Winter is definitely here and hiking season is reaching a quick close.</p><p>\r\n	Now that I am done, I am resting and recovering at the Lohrenz Shelter for Displaced Persons on Whidbey Island for a few weeks. All of the gear is clean, repaired, and stored.  All photos are edited and captioned for one to view on <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/reedmaniac/sets/72157634332346702/\">Flickr</a>. And I had a job interview for a job in Bellingham this past Thursday.</p><p>\r\n	Still, I feel a bit adrift and am slightly frustrated that I really have nothing to do. After five months of hiking nearly every single day, it is difficult to simply stop and try to take it easy.  My body definitely needs the rest though. The bottoms of my feet have yet to stop aching and the knees are still requesting more time off as well. Patience is becoming the word of the day. Things will come in time: healing, job, exercise, money, direction.</p><p>\r\n	I am just ever so curious and ready to start. What\'s next?</p>', '2013-09-30 00:47:53', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'ddfdcedb-0ea5-432e-a06e-560dc04b4f24'),
 ('66', '112', 'en_us', 'The Post-Hike Doldrums', '<p>The first few days after a thru-hike seem to be a bit more organized and settled than the week after. When you first get off the trail, you still have a bit of a journey to get clean, fed, and back to some location, be it your own home or the home of friends and family. There are many hikers who continue exploring, this time in the cities, hoping to find the perfect place to settle.</p><p>After you get back to civilization and settled, then what? Reading various thru-hiker blogs and from my own personal experience, there is a frustrating and listless adjustment period back in civilization. You just spent the last five months with relatively simple and direct goals. Find the next water source, make it to the next resupply, continue hiking.</p><p>The frontcountry is not like that, at all. It is complicated, messy, noisy, indirect, and far less picturesque. Your activity level also just went from 10-12 hours a day to zero, so your endorphine levels tank.  Frankly, part of me feels like post-trail life is a directionless, monotonous, tedious mess and that I would be far better off surviving out there on the trail than back in civilization.</p><p>Alas, that is not an option.  One must rejoin society, at least for a time, and address all of those niggling little issues like money, job, and the nebulous \"future plans\".</p><p>My current plan is to work until I head back to school to finish my pre-medicine prerequisites. My intention was to take Organic Chemistry next summer, which would allow me to tackle Biochemistry, Physics, Genetics, and perhaps a bit of Physiology that next school year. Seems that most businesses or organizations do not really want to hear that you might only be with them for a year (or two if it is a really great job). That\'s frustrating. As if they have a guarantee from the rest of their employees that they will most assuredly be there for years to come. I am willing to commit fully to a really hard worked, challenging year of work.  Given my skills and experience, I can only hope some organization realizes that that is a good deal.</p><p>In the meantime, I am trying to address all of the physical complications of the hike. Without a continuous source of moisture, my dog-esque foot pads have started cracking (lotion to the rescue!). The muscles have finally ceased to ache upon rising from a sitting position though and my heels are thinking about no longer being sore in the morning. Progress.</p><p>A new pair of running shoes just arrived from Amazon yesterday and I unpacked my duffel to find my running/biking clothing. Thinking my first trail run may be tomorrow. The constant rain and wind on the island makes me think biking will have to wait until a weather window opens up; do not feel mentally ready for biking in shitty conditions near traffic.  I also need to stop eating so much junk food. Sure there are complex salads and healthy drinks back in my diet, but in less than 24 hours I have finished off a container of Trader Joe\'s Peanut Butter Cups. Boredom will do that to a former thru-hiker.</p><p>The most important thing is patience and a sense of direction. Not everything will be resolved overnight or even over the next couple weeks. Taking a deep breath and learning to accept that is probably the best step to adjusting to being off trail.</p>', '2013-10-02 21:09:35', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'a3001518-cf23-4830-8ce5-b5ca788044c6'),

 ('68', '114', 'en_us', 'Gear Review: The Big Three', '<p>\r\n	Taking a cue from Amelia\'s first post-hike \r\n	<a href=\"http://ameliorator.blogspot.com/2013/10/gear-review-big-three.html\">gear review</a>, I am breaking my reviews up into slightly more manageable chunks.  This first one will be about the big three of backpacking: the pack, the sleeping bag, and the tent. All totaled, these three items were 4.9 pounds of my base weight and cost $975.00.  Definitely earning the name Big Three as that is a third of my base weight and about half of my gear cost.</p><p>\r\n	<strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Big-Agnes-Copper-Ultralight-Backpacking/dp/B00224Z7QE/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1</a></strong><strong><br>\r\n	</strong></p><p>\r\n	<img src=\"http://shapelesschaos.com/assets/uploads/tent.png\" style=\"width:640px;height:auto;\"></p><p>\r\n	I originally started out with a Tarptent Contrail, which Amelia greatly loved, but I found myself becoming more and more annoyed during the first couple weeks thanks to the wind storms and poor staking conditions; to the point that there were situations where I really should have put up my tent but I did not want to trouble myself. Not a good sign, so I ordered the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL 1 at the Big Bear Lake hostel and had it delivered to The Saufleys in Agua Dulce.</p><p>\r\n	Chose the Copper Spur for a few reasons.  It is a free standing tent, has a side vestibule (compared to the front vestibule on the Fly Creek), and is longer than the Fly Creek (I am 6\'1\").  The weight was around half a pound heavier than the Contrail, but I got a tent that would not collapse under wind or snow, had slightly more head room, and if it was a gorgeous night and I just wanted bug protection I could still see the moon, stars, and the occasional meteor shower.  Was pleased with my choice.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Pros:</strong> Sturdy, free-standing, easy to stake, simple setup, great for buggy environments, dries super-quick, and tough.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Cons:</strong> Bit heavier than most UL options, comfortable but not roomy for a large guy, rather pricey if you do not have a famous REI 20% coupon.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Recommended. I was happy with my choice.  Might be tempted to try another ultralight option in the future though (ex: <a href=\"http://www.zpacks.com/shelter/hexamid_plus.shtml\">Hexamid</a>), if I had spare cash, as the weight did bug me a bit.</p><p>\r\n	<strong><a href=\"http://www.zpacks.com/quilts/sleepingbag.shtml\">ZPacks 20 Degree Down Sleeping Bag</a> (Wide, X-Long)</strong></p><p>\r\n	<img src=\"http://shapelesschaos.com/assets/uploads/green_quilt_top_l.jpg\" style=\"width:640px;height:auto;\"></p><p>\r\n	Like many thru-hikers, I did my research and was intending to use a \r\n	<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-ultralite-sleeping-bag-20-degree-down-wes0031\">Western Mountaineering Ultralite down sleeping bag</a>. Right towards the end of the trip planning phase, while reading Yet Another Hiking Blog (YAHB), I discovered ZPacks.  The Western Mountaineering Ultralite long was 31 oz, while the ZPacks Wide, X-Long was only 21.7 oz.  And it was cheaper.  The ZPacks bag is basically what happens when a down quilt and a down sleeping bag have a baby, with a couple genetic enhancements.  It was fantastic.</p><p>\r\n	The only real downside really had to do with the trail itself. Quite often a 20 degree bag was overkill in the desert.  And yet, three days later that bag could be indispensable when a freezing cold night happened. Washington rained on us almost a third of the times, so  I protected my sleeping bag by putting it inside a trash bag inside a cuben sack inside the trash compactor bag lined part of my pack.  Even with that, a handful of times it got a bit damp while unstuffed in my tent.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Pros:</strong> Warm, lightweight, compressible, did not cover my head (I suffer from anti-mummy tendencies and prefer a hat), worked great as a blanket.  When it was really cold, it was AMAZING!</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Cons: </strong>Expensive. Bit too warm for about half of California. Constant vigilance required in Washington to keep it dry.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Recommended.  If I had to do it again, I might consider using a higher degree bag and then carrying a liner for the Sierras and Washington.</p><p>\r\n	<strong><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/packs/backpacks/mariposa-ultralight-backpack-all.html\">Gossamer Gear Mariposa</a></strong><sub><br>\r\n	</sub></p><p>\r\n	<img src=\"{asset:117:url}\"></p><p>\r\n	Sadly, I do not have a good shot of myself using this backpack in the wild. Typically I was carrying it on my back, so I suppose that is not completely unexpected. Stock photo to the rescue!</p><p>\r\n	Probably one of the pieces of ultralight gear I was most skeptical about.  Currently, I have four other backpacks that I use for all variety of purposes: guiding, mountaineering, quick summit hops from basecamp, et cetera.  For me a pack needs to hold the right amount of gear comfortably for days while making my gear easily accessible.  Surely a pack that ways less than 2 pounds could not handle all of the trials of a thru-hike.  <em>I was wrong.</em>  Except for when it was overloaded with a bear canister and/or 6-7 days worth of food, it worked perfectly.  It was meant to carry 35 pounds or less, and I think that is spot on.  Go over that and your pack (and you) will suffer for it.  The aluminum stays and padding is just not capable of handling more than that amount of weight or strain.  You have been warned.</p><p>\r\n	By the way, its removable pad for sitting is a great idea.  I used it constantly during breaks and meals. So much in fact that I eventually had to replace it in Echo Lake.  Hat tip to Gossamer Gear for that idea.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Pros:</strong> Lightweight, cheap, durable (2668+ miles and still usable), perfect volume for a thru-hiker.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Cons:</strong> Both grommets came out and had to be repaired with floss and needle.  Not ideal for heavy loads in the Sierras. I am hard on my gear so I tried to be a bit more gentle with this pack to insure it survived the journey.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Recommended. They informed me via email that they know about the grommet issue and are addressing it.  For the Sierras, I think I would have mailed myself one of my heavier and more sturdier packs (Osprey Atmos?) to make the large loads more comfortable.</p>', '2013-10-06 18:53:43', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', '4590a199-0b31-4475-9bba-87aa0b8fe4f8'),

Gone is the era when four hobbits would cuddle together underneath an outcropping with their wool cloaks wrapped tightly around them, a rock their only pillow.  If you ask me, we have all lost a little of ourselves by letting that go.  Anyhoo...</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Pros:</strong> Lightweight, compact, excellent insulation, no slipping.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Cons: </strong>Can be punctured. I very foolishly put a bag with a sharp object underneath it in the Sierras while elevating my feet. Went right through both sides.  Thankfully, the tenacious tape worked spectacularly and held the rest of the trip.  Also, I admit it is a bit noisy at first.  After the first week or two, I stopped noticing.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Recommended? Yes, oh yes.  I am not the best sleeper and never having to worry about rocks, roots, or cold ground was fantastic.</p><h4>\r\nCooking - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004RA03LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">JetBoil Sol Titanium</a>, Grease Pot, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824989/snow-peak-titanium-spork-colored\">Snow Peak Titanium Spork (Purple)</a></h4><h5><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824989/snow-peak-titanium-spork-colored\"></a></h5><p>\r\n	<img src=\"{asset:123:url}\"></p><p>\r\n	When you absolutely positively have to boil water quickly, the JetBoil cannot be beat. While most thru-hikers were still figuring out where to safely put their alcohol stoves, my water was already boiled.  It is actually so fast that I spent less time boiling the water than finding the food I wanted to eat in my food bag.  So, if all you are doing is rehydrating meals of potatoes, oatmeal, instant rice, noodles, et cetera and you are not fond of the wait or issues with alcohol, then this is the stove for you.</p><p>\r\n	However, you cannot cook with it.  Well, that is not entirely true, you can cook with it, but it is a pain in the ass. I used the ol\' trusted method of cooking food inside of a freezer bag placed inside the boiling water to cook a few meals.  Did not find it particularly enjoyable or easy.  During the first week I tried, foolishly, to cook some noodles in the JetBoil, completely against the recommendations of the manufacturer.  There are still burnt marks on the bottom of the pot.</p><p>\r\n	The stove also sips fuel.  One of the small 100g canisters typically lasted me 3 weeks when having one or two meals a day.  A fellow hiker gave me a full canister of one of the larger sizes (230g, I think).  It lasted me all the way from Echo Lake, CA to Timberline Lodge, OR.  A distance of over a thousand miles.  That is damn impressive.  If you do choose a JetBoil, leave the stand at home.  I never used it.</p><p>\r\n	The Grease Pot was a great vessel for my meals.  Lightweight and very resilient to the beatings of a thru-hike.  And during the day I put all of my snacks inside it on the outside of my pack.  Worked out great.  As for the Titanium Spork: it survived the entire trip completely intact.  I think the \"fork\" aspect is unnecessary though.  I used it more for opening packages than I ever did for spearing my food.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Pros: </strong>Fast boiling, sips fuel, lightweight, and the envy of morning coffee drinkers with an alcohol stove.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Cons:</strong> Bit heavier than an alcohol stove. No simmering.  Fork aspect of spork was not necessary.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Recommended.  Would probably choose a titanium spoon over the spork and insure it is of a size that it would fit in the pot.</p><h4>\r\nWater Treatment - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OR111G/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Aqua Mira</a></h4><p>\r\n	In retrospect, starting with the Sawyer Squeeze Filter was a nice experiment but it should have never gone on the trip. Even during testing at home I became impatient with the amount of time it took to squeeze a couple litres into my Platypus Platy Bottles, especially since the bottles were flexible and did not stand up well when empty.  Thru-hikers simply want their gear to work quickly and well, but once you leak water onto your pants for the tenth time, forget to bring the filter into to the tent on a freezing cold night, or have issues back flushing...the Sawyer filter has failed that test.</p><p>\r\n	So, my backup water treatment was two wee bottles of Aquamira.  Once I started using those I never looked back and bought more on Amazon and shipped them to myself as necessary. Towards the end even Amelia was using it.  Many people complain online about the 5 minutes required for the two chemicals to react before being put into the water.  Honestly, if you think about how long it takes to fill up the bottles, go pee, and grab a snack you are essentially at 5 minutes.  I had two 1-litre bottles that I cycled through for drinking that were in one of my side pockets, so I added the Aquamira and kept on walking.  15 minutes later, I could drink the water.  Pretty darn easy.</p><p>\r\n	There are other \r\n	<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_water_purification\">ways to treat water</a> in the wilderness (such as <a href=\"http://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=-1118142891\">bleach</a>), but <a href=\"http://iaspub.epa.gov/tdb/pages/treatment/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=-1277754943\">chlorine dioxide</a> (aka Aquamira) is more effective against Cryptosporidium and Giardia while also improving the taste of the water and not creating any harmful byproducts.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Pros:</strong> Quick, easy, reliable, better than bleach or filters, reasonably cheap</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Cons:</strong> None unless you are really impatient.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Recommended.</p><h4>\r\nWater Containers - Bottled water bottles, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000J2KEGY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Platypus Platy Bottles</a></h4><p>\r\n	When you have to carry more than 2 litres, say in most of California except for the Sierras, the Platy bottles are fantastic.  Large capacity, lightweight, and collapse quite small.  They only lasted me about 800 miles before developing a leak though.  For everywhere else and for daily drinking, I used bottled water bottles put into a side pocket of my pack.  Replaced them about every three weeks or so.</p><h4>\r\n<strong>Digital Device - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-32GB-Black-Unlocked/dp/B0097CZF5C/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">iPhone 5</a></strong></h4><p>\r\n	Best thing ever. Camera, GPS, navigation, email, browser, music, videos.  Damn thing does it all (and extremely well) and is a phone too. While having a digital device is not \r\n	<em>necessary</em> for a thru-hike, I would say it is extremely worthwhile.  When mine was stolen in Castella, it really knocked me down.  Losing my photos and videos, connection to the outer world, and entertainment was a huge blow. Thanks to it happening after a really challenging stretch, it was probably the closest I came to quitting.  Thank goodness for an <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/icloud/features/#backup\">automatic online backup</a> in Burney the week before, otherwise I might have lost over 500 miles worth of photos and notes.</p><p>\r\n	Since it is an electronic device and you are going backpacking for five months in all kinds of conditions, it makes sense that it needs a bit more protection than what is required in civilization.  I put mine in an \r\n	<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Incipio-Dual-PRO-iPhone-Packaging/dp/B0098FKKPI/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reedmaniaccom-20 \">Incipio case</a> and then a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CJYUXW/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Loksak bag</a> to protect it from dust, sweat, and rain.</p><p>\r\n	There are a few apps that I recommend you look at:</p><ul>\r\n	\r\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/halfmiles-pct/id521937514?mt=8\">Halfmile\'s PCT</a></li>	\r\n<li>Guthook (<a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guthooks-pct-southern-california/id503652257?mt=8\">Southern CA</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guthooks-pct-central-california/id509016353?mt=8\">Central CA</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guthooks-pct-northern-california/id511715959?mt=8\">Northern CA</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guthooks-pct-oregon/id514159949?mt=8\">Oregon</a>, <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/guthooks-pct-washington/id518350895?mt=8\">Washington</a>)</li>	\r\n<li><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pcthyoh/id461413265?mt=8\">PCTHYOH</a></li></ul><p>\r\n	The \r\n	<em>Halfmile</em> app is based off <a href=\"http://www.pctmap.net\">Halfmile\'s notes and maps</a>, which are <strong>the</strong> maps for the Pacific Crest Trail. Using your GPS coordinates, it can tell you where you are on the trail (or how to get back to it) and also the distance to the next Halfmile landmark.  However, after the Sierras, Halfmiles notes are fewer in number and you will start becoming frustrated when you walk by additional water sources or campsites that are never mentioned.  <em>Guthook\'s</em> apps fills in the blanks with far more water sources (springs!), campsites, and additional details + photos. When you are hiking 20-30 miles a day in all kinds of conditions and terrain, it is helpful to know if the next reliable water source or campsite is around that next bend or 6 miles beyond.  The <em>Guthook</em> app was a bit buggy at times and does not give you any calculated distances to destinations, but it was regularly updated while on trail so hopefully it will continue improving.</p><p>\r\n	The \r\n	<em>PCTHYOH</em> app is simply a nice way to cache PCT related information on your phone (ex: PDFs of Halfmile\'s maps). Found it handy a few times when I wanted to look at Halfmile\'s elevation profiles in my tent.  Eventually I stopped using it as the other two covered 99% of what I needed.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Pros: </strong>Amazing digital multi-tool.  Able to order stuff from Amazon while on trail. Replaces physical maps. Apps for everything!</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive when you consider contract. Can be stolen or broken, so you have to protect it.  Requires power (see next review).</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line: </strong>Highly recommended. My favorite piece of gear.</p><h4><strong>POWER!! - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G739C4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">sCharger-5 High Performance Solar Charger</a> </strong></h4><p>\r\n	With the iPhone being used every single day and there being 4-7 days in between towns, it was necessary to have some manner of way to recharge the phone on trail.  The \r\n	<a href=\"http://wanderingthewild.com/2012/12/03/gear-review-cameras-solar-panel-apps-and-phones/\">Wandering the Wild</a> blog highly praised the sCharger-5, so I gave it shot. It does not have a battery and the iPhone 5 requires a strong, steady stream of power, which requires that you use it primarily during breaks when there is full sun.  Not a problem in most of California and Oregon.  The only time I had to conserve power was when the charger stopped working (manufacturing defect, apparently) and was without it.  Easily recharged my phone in 1-2 hours, perfect for lunch breaks.</p><p>\r\n	In Washington, I switched to the \r\n	<a href=\"http://www.suntactics.com/shop/5000ma-usb-battery-2/\">Suntactics USB Battery</a> and sent the charger home. That also worked extremely well and could recharge my phone at least 2 times, which is perfect for a 4-6 day stretch. Only complaint there is I think with a bit more engineering work (cost?) they might be able to make the entire device a bit smaller.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Pros: </strong>Simple, fast, and more reliable than other brands.  Company was <em>extremely</em> responsive when charger stopped working and shipped me a new one via priority mail.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Cons: </strong>It did break at a rather inopportune time. Pricey.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line:</strong> Recommended for California, especially if traveling with friends who want to use it too. I found their USB Battery so reliable though that I would recommend it as a lighter, cheaper alternative.</p>', '2013-10-09 01:05:33', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'c361bae3-2305-450b-95f0-a6445bb90d43'),

 ('81', '127', 'en_us', 'Post-Hike First Aid Kit', '<p>\r\n	When I was \r\n	<a href=\"http://shapelesschaos.com/blog/certifiable\">building</a> my first-aid kit for the Pacific Crest Trail, oh so many months ago, I was aiming for a balance between weight and what my training would realistically let me handle in the wilderness. Naturally, there is a great deal of disagreement and debate on what should be taken for first aid in the outdoor community–both on solo and guided trips. On one side is this perfectly valid point from Andrew Skurka:</p><blockquote>\r\n	Even if I carried 50 pounds of medical equipment and was a certified EMT, I’m still not equipped to treat serious medical problems in the field over the long-term.\r\n</blockquote><p>Based on this, he goes to one extreme and carries only what he considers the barest essentials.  If something more serious goes wrong, he pulls out the satellite phone and calls for help. On the other end of the spectrum, there are organizations like Reed College that have a legal obligation to send their guides out with both a satellite phone <em>and</em> a substantial first aid kit–one with enough supplies to treat the majority of wilderness medical issues, perhaps for days on end. </p><p>As a certified Wilderness EMT, who <em>is</em> trained to handle a serious emergency in the field for days, even with minimal resources, the severe minimalistic approach to first aid that most thru-hikers subscribe to is foolhardy. Quite a few head out with no more than duct tape and ibuprofen. Essentially, they are operating under the assumption that nothing bad will happen or if it does, someone else will rescue them.  This thin margin of safety would often extend to their food and water.  A number of thru-hikers would be out of food the night before their next resupply or would show up at water sources having been empty for miles. While the PCT is reasonably well traveled and usually less than a day away from civilization, there are 5-7 day sections without a single road and no reliable cell service. Further, even if someone does show up within a short amount of time (not always the best assumption itself), it does not mean they will have the materials or skills to help you out. Nature is unreliable and relying on luck is no way to head into the wilderness.  The Boy Scount motto rings true: Be Prepared.</p><p>Please think clearly about what your skills are and how much you are willing to risk. Humans–and thru-hikers especially–are a hardy and resilient lot. Things do go wrong though and if you are not prepared, it can cost you dearly. Shortly after I finished the PCT this year, a series of snowstorms hit the Cascades.  Hikers continued heading out even though they had not adequately prepared for the winter conditions (snowshoes, extra clothes and food).  Multiple people had to be rescued, a few by helicopter because Search & Rescue could not safely reach them by foot.  They were unprepared for those winter conditions and risked their own lives and the lives of others by their foolishness. Whether you head into the wilderness for a day hike or an expedition, it is grossly irresponsible to be ill-prepared for the conditions and challenges of being out there.</p><p>So. The most important part of any first aid kit is your mind: education and knowing what to bring and how to use it.  One of the things that bugs me about Skurka\'s opinion is it seems to gloss over the educational aspect of first aid. You can do more with bare minimal supplies and training than just minimal supplies. I highly suggest that if you are doing any kind of backpacking or hiking, you find a <a href=\"http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wfr.shtml\">Wilderness First Responder</a> course nearby and take it. You will not regret it and it is often a requirement for any sort of guiding.  If you want to get really serious about wilderness first aid and have a free month, look at becoming a <a href=\"http://www.nols.edu/wmi/courses/wemt.shtml\">Wilderness EMT</a>.  I do not recommend taking a Wilderness First Aid course. It is too short and the friends who have taken it did not have a high retention of the material.</p><h4>PCT First Aid Kit Supplies</h4><p>One of the critiques that Amelia brought against my <a href=\"http://shapelesschaos.com/blog/certifiable\">original PCT first aid kit</a> was that I designed it not for myself but for everyone else.

It traverses deserts, forests, mountains, and snow. You reach an elevation of 13,153 feet at Forester Pass and go nearly to sea level at Cascade Locks. Temperatures on the trip will range from 0°-110° Fahrenheit and include everything from scalding heat to downpours to a couple feet of snow.  And, lest we forget, swarms of mosquitos and wind storms make regular appearances. One\'s clothing is, thus, incredibly important.  Here\'s what I had for the duration of the trail.</p><h4>Daily</h4><ul>\r\n	<li>Hiking Shirt: <a href=\"http://www.railriders.com/men-eco-mesh-shirt-p-963.html?cPath=90_96\">RailRiders Eco-Mesh Shirt</a></li>	<li>Hiking Pants: <a href=\"http://www.railriders.com/men-bone-flats-pants-p-992.html?cPath=104_110\">RailRiders Bone Flats Pants</a></li>	<li>Underwear: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M0MMVC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">ExOfficio Give-N-Go Boxer</a></li>	<li>Hat: Straw Hat from KMart</li>	<li>Socks: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Darn-Tough-Merino-Micro-Cushion/dp/B000XFW6OU/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Darn Tough</a></li>	<li>Mosquito Head Net: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CTVNV8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Sea to Summit Mosquito Head Net</a></li>	<li>Gaiters: <a href=\"http://www.dirtygirlgaiters.com/goingbatty.html\">Dirty Girl Gaiters - Going Batty</a></li>	<li>Shoes: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006K6DFEQ/ref=cm_sw_su_dp?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Brooks Cascadia 7 Trail Running Shoes</a></li></ul><p>\r\n	Everything here is highly recommended.  The Hiking Shirts and Pants are designed to be lightweight, dry quickly, protect you from the sun and mosquitos, and provide airflow in the desert.  By Oregon the pants had worn out in the bottom, so it was replaced with just the shorts portion of an old pair of REI convertible pants.  Been using the ExOfficio boxers for years both in the outdoors and when I travel, they are perfect.</p><p>\r\n	<strong>Socks</strong></p><p>\r\n	I started out with SmartWool lightweight running socks and then switched to the KEEN socks when they arrived. Neither survived more than a couple weeks. Seemed like every other town stop I was trying a different brand of socks and none of them were surviving the sweat, grime, and dirt of the desert.  Finally, I caved and bought two pairs of Darn Toughs.  Do it. They are thicker and warmer than the lightweight socks, but they will last.  I only had a single pair develop a hole and the company replaces their socks with no questions asked.  Because they are thicker, they do take a while to dry, so I had four pairs through Washington (rain, rain, rain) opposed to my usual two pairs.</p><h4>Insulating</h4><ul>\r\n	<li>Warm Hat: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/SmartWool-SW956-Smartwool-Cuffed-Beanie/dp/B000OCJKS2/?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Smartwool Cuffed Beanie</a></li>	<li>Insulating Layer: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DJWDIK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Mountain Hardwear Synthetic Puffy</a></li>	<li>Long Underwear - Top: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TZ3FP0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">SmartWool Midweight Crew Top</a></li>	<li>Long Underwear - Bottom: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008TZ41HQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">SmartWool Midweight Long Underwear Bottoms</a></li>	<li>Gloves: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Black-Diamond-LightWeight-Glove/dp/B0046YJJIA/ref=pd_sim_sbs_sg_2?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Black Diamond Lightweight Gloves</a></li></ul><p>\r\n	Again, everything here is highly recommended. In parts of California it was too warm for my sleeping bag, so many nights I just put on my underwear and slept that way (after a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Wet-Ones-Antibacterial-Travel-15-Count/dp/B0045XDGZ4/ref=sr_1_4?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Wet Wipes</a> bath).  The long underwear became my nightly wear in Oregon and Washington thanks to the colder and wetter than average conditions.  Nothing like getting out of your wet hiking clothes and sliding into dry wool before bed.</p><p>\r\n	The gloves were probably used only two or three times in California, so I tossed the old pair I had into a hiker box early on.  However, I bought a new pair in Oregon and was grateful for them in Washington with all of the cold mornings and snow towards the end.</p><h4>Rain/Snow</h4><ul>\r\n	<li>Rain Coat: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Arcteryx-Beta-AR-Jacket-Medium/dp/B00DR0FCLW/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\">Arc\'teryx Men\'s Beta AR</a></li>	<li>Rain Pants: <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/844642/rei-rainwall-pants-mens-32-inseam\">REI Rainwall Pants</a></li></ul><p>\r\n	I started the hike with just a poncho, but thanks to our first rain storm being rather windy, I decided to get a lightweight jacket in Big Bear Lake.  For Washington though, I was really grateful for my Arc\'teryx jacket.  I have owned (and abused) it for years and it is an excellent piece of gear.  The rain pants did not join me until Washington either.  Would have been nice to have them for parts of Oregon when we got drenched for a couple days, but I survived without it.</p><h4>Overall</h4><p>\r\n	I did quite a bit of research into gear in the months before my trip and have had decades of experience in the outdoors before then. I know how my body responds to sun, heat, cold, wind, and wet quite well.  Everyone is a bit different though.  Amelia is so pale that she burns in no time in direct sun.  I can survive in dry, cold, and wet just fine but if you combine heat and humidity you will see me wither.  Do a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice.html\">bit of research</a> about outdoor clothing (desert/winter, synthetics/cotton, layering) and experiment with what works for you beforehand.</p><h4>Additional Links</h4><p>\r\n	<a href=\"http://andrewskurka.com/2013/clothing-system-for-backpacking-peak-mosquito-season/\">Andrew Skurka\'s Clothing System in Alaska<br></a><a href=\"http://ameliorator.blogspot.com/2013/10/gear-review-laundry-list.html\">Amelia\'s PCT Clothing</a></p>', '2013-10-27 20:04:00', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', '293caded-c0fa-4afc-a658-364cc93a5824'),
 ('84', '130', 'en_us', 'The Secret Life of the Thru-Hiker', '<p>Returning to civilization has been more of a struggle than I expected.  While thru-hiking I can only remember a few mornings when it was exceptionally difficult to get out of my sleeping bag and continue hiking. Most days that simple, focused, and uncompromising purpose of continuing <strong><em>North</em></strong> was sufficient motivation.  That drive forward on the trail is so powerful that even serious injuries that should have been given a week off rarely got more than a single day.  When I took two full days off, it was obvious to every single thru-hiker that I was in serious pain.</p><p>Back here in the Real World, it all feels so ridiculously complicated.  There are so many considerations that need to be carefully Tetris\'ed into my life: employment, money, living situation, bills, driving, socializing, rehabilitation of injured parts, and even what to eat. Over six weeks of being off trail and I am still experiencing a low level of anxiety every single day.  It is not a pleasant experience.  So bad that most times when I visit the grocery store, I only grab fresh produce and chocolate.  Circulating among the other aisles stresses me out.</p><p>Not exactly fantasizing about being back on the trail either. That trip is over. But, I am definitely thinking about the <em>next</em> trip; the next time that I can get be <em>out <strong>there</strong></em>. For me, \"Why am I here?\" is a constant refrain in my mind.  Why should I not be out there in the forests, deserts, and mountains of the world? Isn\'t that where I belong?  Staring out a coffee shop window at the gorgeous autumn weather when I should be examining spreadsheets for the new job is definitely reinforcing this feeling.</p><p>Still, I must bend my will to spending time <em>here;</em> refilling the coffers and reconnecting with people, relearning to labor and wait.  Just for a while longer.</p>', '2013-11-02 21:41:43', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', 'c6f7a821-dfbf-434a-bf74-73db7419c34e'),

Hours and hours have been wasted trying to write it down with it never becoming sufficiently coherent enough for posting.</p><p>Thankfully, I have Amelia both as my best friend and a fellow thru-hiker.

I cannot say for sure, but I do not <em>feel</em> like I am suffering from depression.  Getting up every morning, going to work, eating healthy, daily exercise, sleeping reasonably well, and starting to make plans for the coming year.  Instead of a lack of energy, I feel an overwhelming surplus of it.  And time, so much time.  How do you people handle weekends? And nights?

In inverse proportion to how much I like to publicly discuss my true inner thoughts and past history, I am fascinated by how others perceive me. The first person narrative is the most important, but I have access to all the secrets and have evaluated most of the inner workings, so it lacks novelty. And ultimately how others perceive you is directly related to what you can accomplish in this world.</p><p>At one time or another I have been referred to as a reckless fool, manic-depressive, insane, black hearted, soulless, untrustworthy, asocial, utterly ruthless, vain, and unhealthy. Heartwarming to be sure and there has been a joke that all potential mates should be given a stern warning and an informative pamphlet prior to a first date. On the flip side, I have also been described–often by the same people–as calculating, reliable, loving, strong willed, charming, principled, and one of their closest friends. I find an emotional core strengthening program is important in preventing whiplash.</p><p>I question myself if I could be rightly called all those things and it is a resounding yes. Naturally, those labels pale in comparison to how I think of myself.</p><p>\"All the world is a stage,\" goes the adage; one that often seems poorly rehearsed and written at the last minute–typically on a typewriter with a few sticky keys. But consider, if you will, that a play is just a three hour presentation, which has months and months of preparation and work behind it. That backstage perspective is how every single person thinks of him or herself on the stage of life. There are decades of memories and entire days full of positive/negative, emotional, and physical stresses behind every interpersonal interaction. That thought echoes through my brain every single time I interact with another person. It drives me a bit insane but it also gives me a much needed dose of perspective when things go awry.</p><p>Our actions are how others define us. What we are underneath only matters to us. That is one of the reasons I keep a great deal of my thoughts and machinations to myself. As much as people like to claim they are open and accepting, there are stigmas, stereotypes, and fears laying just under the surface. People like to name and categorize their world into simpler terms; understanding and accepting the underlying complexity is neither a pleasant nor relaxing way of living. Based on my experience, few are willing to put in the legwork and clemency on a daily basis.</p><p>If I detailed every single thought that flies through my head in a single hour, I think even my closest friends would be aghast. As much as it tickles me to idolize the likes of Sherlock Holmes, The Doctor, or Batman, there is a curse in their approach to humanity. Our ideals and heroes can shape us just as much as our experiences, and in my attempts to explore the depths and limits of who I am, I have lost a certain amount of approachability and even perhaps sanity. There are even days when I feel I am losing my humanity.</p><p>That sounds dark. It is not, at least not to me; I think of it as all encompassing. I have suffered from depression, rage, and loneliness. Of course I have contemplated suicide or running away to a remote location. I have also contemplated true love, marriage, and children. The scope of my thoughts and reasoning are not bound in any way. </p><p>What it comes down to is that I want to be more than who I am now. I continually feel incomplete and unsatisfactory. Staying still is not an option. When I see people relaxing their guard and slowing down, I know in my bones that that is not who I am. I want to do more; no, scratch that, I need to do more.</p><p>----</p><p>Well, that is one of my perspectives at least.</p>', '2014-03-08 19:24:50', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', '77e65299-7b26-45e5-a7c8-2b5c9472c6bd'),

I am not sure how to politely phrase it to them how <em>incredibly</em> annoyed that makes me.  Every single day I am acutely aware that I have scar tissue in my tendon and missing articular cartilage on my patella. I habitually massage my knee whenever I sit down; almost as if subconsciously I believe I can rub the damage away.  My knee is never going to be \"good\" again.</p><p>In all probability, gone are the days when I would run a half marathon before breakfast. Those intense trail running days where I would fly through the woods of Forest Park are likely behind me. Not only would attempting to run them be unpleasant, but my orthopedic surgeon believes it would cause more damage in the long term. Alas, the medical technology does not yet exist where we can reliably regrow cartilage and smooth scar tissue.</p><p>Obviously, I can still be extremely active with it. Thanks to another month of physical therapy post-trail and constant exercises, I can reliably do three hour bike rides, swim two miles in the pool, and row nearly an hour on the erg without pain. Further, just last evening I was at the gym and after an hour of biking and rowing, I finally pulled off 200 lunges. If I am patient and slowly increase the length and difficulty of my exercises, I can strengthen my knees to a level where I can safely do mountaineering and full day bike rides, perhaps even on consecutive days.  Patience and commitment are key though.</p><p>I love being active. Prior to my knee injury, I took a special joy in not giving a damn about races or training programs, yet still smoking serious athletes during runs or rides. Whenever people get too serious about stroking their egos, I get bored.  Who really cares about PRs? Did you have fun? Was there joy in what you did? Pushing yourself to the point of exhaustion and still grinning is one of the best feelings. Staring at a watch is ever so boring.</p><p>Of course, I will never win a race. I lack the discipline and the requisite hardcore psychological quirk that drives athletic people to track their protein intake and heart rate. The idea of flying to another state to run 26.2 miles on pavement? Inconceivable.</p><p>My workouts are meant for one thing and one thing only, to permit by body to do even more. I constantly daydream about biking 200 miles in one day (Hood River to The Dalles to Mt. Bachelor), doing another thru-hike, and organizing a weekend adventure race of my own devising with swimming, biking, climbing, and kayaking.</p><p>If you ever want to do truly amazing things with your body and push it to point of making things seem effortless, that is how you need to train, not for numbers or ego but for fun and joy.

 ('146', '134', 'en_us', 'A Shadow\'s Shadow', '<p>If there is one component of my personality that seems to cause the most difficulties, it is my questioning of nearly every component of my life, repeatedly and without mercy. Even when an internal consensus is reached on a topic and an action taken, I will still reflect on it long after the fact and possibly reopen the floor to debate after a suitable amount of time has passed. It is a rare topic that has an edict against further deliberation.</p><p>The recurrent one that I think most people can relate to is \"why am I here?\" Of course, at any given moment it might refer broadly to my continued existence on our fair planet or narrowly as to who I am socializing with at a certain time and place. It is a tricky thing constantly questioning each of your motivations, probable consequences of your actions, and willingness to accept those consequences. Something as simple as meeting a friend for breakfast will occupy a prime place on the carousel of my thoughts for days beforehand. </p><p>Because of that carousel, I rarely take action without being acutely aware of the influence that a choice may have on my life. Of course, I am exceedingly aware of how chaotic and unpredictable life is. You can ruminate as frequently and deeply as you wish, but you will never see the complete patterns of consequence until they are well behind you. With all of my deductive reasoning skills, knowledge, and experience I cannot even hope to reliably predict all of what will happen tomorrow, let alone the rest of my life.</p><p>Consider all the interwoven patterns of human interaction that you superficially perceive on a day to day basis, then think back to those moments in your life that were the <em>true</em>, root cause of a dramatic shift in the direction of your day/year/life.</p><p>Leaving my dorm room door open on a sunny Saturday morning Sophomore year; applying for a programming job that I was laughably underqualified for; jumping down from a rock ledge on Mt. Adams. I just want to laugh at the absolute absurdity of trying to prepare or plan for anything.</p><p>This is all a long winded way of introducing how I perceive my actions. There are absolutely no promises in life. Even if you believe in a God or gods, there is no guarantee you will get safety, comfort, or happiness. The Universe is rather ambivalent towards your needs and wants. For some, that realization means they seize onto whatever feels the most stable. That is not so much my public modus operandi.</p><p>Which is odd because I do not consider myself reckless or even particularly impressive in my accomplishments. Instead, I consider most everyone else timid and lazy. How can you possibly go through life wanting more and knowing you should do more, and then not do it?  As a well known Dutch author once said: It\'s maddening; I get mad about it.</p><p>I have a tendency to think of my life as a narrative. There are certain themes and rules that I tend to follow, and I aim my actions to fall within those lines. I obsess over my decisions and carefully evaluate how I want to act, but once a decision is reached I take action. Discovering the \"should\" is the hard part, taking action is easy for me.</p><p>I grant there is a certain cold, clinical approach in how I disregard emotional considerations and physical comforts when I believe an action is called for. Breakups are emotionally painful, but if it is necessary there is no reason to delay. Leaving your warm, dry tent and getting moving in cold, wet conditions is unpleasant but you must leave and start hiking. I understand that others are motivated by these considerations in varying degrees, I really do, they just rarely affect my own actions; they lack potency.</p><p>I think our culture is making progress on accepting that there are a wide range of behaviors in humans. The entire introvert/extrovert distinction being one that is often brought up on social media. It bothers me that my actions are given less acquiescence than if I pretended to have those more tender sensibilities that others have and I often seem to lack.

Self-indulgent,&nbsp;magniloquent,&nbsp;florid prose will undoubtedly make brief appearances as&nbsp;a disguise for missing carefully reasoned rhetoric. Extra-hyphens and random semicolons may; or may not; help provide humorous interludes from any and all seriousness. &nbsp;We now continue onto a second paragraph.</p><p>When did drinking alcohol become the&nbsp;irrepressible&nbsp;mainstay of adult fun? Please, do not get me wrong: I do not&nbsp;<em>dislike</em> alcohol. The sheer scope of varieties and concoctions are a testament to our species\' inherent love of it. &nbsp;Furthermore, I have definitely had a decent fill of it throughout the years. &nbsp;As Amelia can attest, if you put food or drink in front of me, I have a compulsion to consume it; it is in my nature. &nbsp;Separate from that, I do not find it particularly inviting as a daily part of life. &nbsp;I brewed beer solely for the novelty, not for the consumption of its alcohol. I enjoy whisky because it has a certain Scottish allure with a burn at the end that has a manly&nbsp;romanticization from so many Westerns. &nbsp;As for wine, every single time I am offered a glass the health benefits are what usually sway me. &nbsp;Saké and sangria are the only alcoholic&nbsp;liquids I am ever genuinely tempted by in a store or restaurant when there are not social pressures. &nbsp;Even then, I am far more likely to drink juice or water.</p><p>Every so often I daydream I have an enzyme that causes alcohol to be less appealing or that certain neurotransmitter receptors are not as beguiled in me as in others. &nbsp;I suspect it is more the fact that I am a bit of a control freak and over the past fifteen years or so I have become less willing to toy with my cerebral cortex and limbic system. &nbsp;I find that on a daily basis, what happens in my noggin is rather sufficient. Do not feel much of a drive to be&nbsp;more talkative, more self-confident, or less socially inhibited. Surely do not feel like my emotions need more free rein,&nbsp;especially publicly. &nbsp;Alcohol will actually inhibit the clarity of my thoughts and dilute the authenticity of what I say and do. &nbsp;That is downright anti-Paul.</p><p>Of course, that is the point of alcohol. &nbsp;You hear it often said that alcohol is a social lubricant. It seems nearly every important work or professional function requires it. To build those relationships, to form those bonds, it is a necessity.&nbsp;It allows people to relax.&nbsp;It breaks down all of those barriers humans put into place to shore up the walls of our public persona. Nearly everyone has those entertaining stories of a crazy night out.</p><p>I think I understand this, but as with so many things I do not accept it as a requirement. Especially given the fact that it tends to go too far, too often. Two weeks ago, I was biking home from a movie and a driver, who I assume was at least mildly inebriated, was speeding down the street and swerved around another car to almost hit me. I cannot emphasize this enough: that is not how I want me or anyone I care about to die. And, if it was a friend driving that car, they would cease to be my friend by their complete and utter idiocy for driving while utter the influence. &nbsp;It is one of the greatest sins to put others in harm\'s way without their permission.</p><p>On the other front, I am weakening friendships when I am not willing to attend parties or get togethers whose primary form of entertainment is drinking and enjoying its effects. &nbsp;I do not mind hanging out and having a drink. The drink aspect is not normally appealing to me, but I am willing to make that sacrifice to be social, with select people. But, a party where you know most participants will be quite drunk by the end is both unenjoyable and boring. &nbsp;More and more I will skip such an event and spend the night watching a movie or reading a book at home, alone. The consequences to my social life be damned.</p><p>I dunno. It\'s weird. It is another area of civilization where I feel regularly out of place. I read Calvin & Hobbes on a daily basis and on some level I identify far more with them than I do with most of my adult friends. I want to play in the woods, daydream about grand adventures, read about dinosaurs, do slightly reckless things, and all the while be both goofy and philosophical in my conversations.

There is a slight problem in that our main product has not launched yet, so we are keeping rather tight lipped about its features and the visual and programmatic design. Also, since a great deal of my work is technical in nature with occasional forays into business matters, it is not terribly interesting or accessible to the majority of people. As worthy of my time as I find building an API with 200+ endpoints and testing load balanced environments with multiple horizontal server resources...it lacks a certain dinner hour approachability. Still, I think the time has come to at least start pulling back a bit of the curtain.</p><p>We are a little over a month away from inviting Portland individuals, companies, and non-profits to help us beta test, and a splash page is already visible at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://impactflow.com/\">ImpactFlow.com</a>. Just last week I finished setting up a complete staging environment on the amazing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forge.laravel.com/\">Laravel Forge</a> and we are prepping to start our internal testing at the end of next week. The pressure is beginning to build; it is quite exciting (if a bit stressful). So, what is this mysterious ImpactFlow?</p><blockquote>ImpactFlow is a marketplace for philanthropy, where individuals and businesses manage their giving like investments to support the causes they care most about. \r\n<p>Nonprofits showcase their projects and get matched to funds from donors they know are interested in the work they are doing.</p></blockquote><p>Philanthropy is a Big Word&trade; that has quite a bit of weight behind it. At its core, it is a catchall term meaning one is trying to make the world better though some manner of giving, be it money, property, or personal time.&nbsp;Like any product, we are trying to solve a problem.&nbsp;If you are truly serious about having an impact with your giving, it is a messy and inefficient process. Each non-profit has its own website and their specific projects may or may not be on it. How their projects impact the community or world at large may not be readily apparent. Directly investing in specific projects that catch your eye is seldom possible. &nbsp;An individual or company can literally spend months searching for the perfect place to give their money, yet still end up just writing a check to the non-profit as a general donation and only receive monthly emails as a result.</p><p>On the flip side, non-profits are always searching for funds and donors. Significant amounts of their budgets are spent researching and applying for grants, contacting donors, and building corporate relationships to insure their projects are funded. Smaller, community-focused non-profits are often overlooked and lose out to more publicly recognizable non-profits. And, if they want to promote how their current projects are doing, they are limited by the capabilities of their website and social media team, if they even have one.</p><p>Imagine if you could bring both sides, funders and non-profits, to one place and meet all of those needs. Funders of any size (individuals, groups, corporations) can build their own giving programs to indicate specifically where they want their money to go. Non-Profts have all of their projects online and those projects are instantly matched to existing giving programs. &nbsp;Conversations and collaboration can happen on both sides, and once funded the projects can provide direct reports to their donors on progress and impact.</p><p>There is an incredible scope to platform and I cannot discuss the details yet, but that is the seed at the core of it. We want to move beyond giving as it currently stands and allow it to be treated more as a professional investment.</p><p>---</p><p>When I joined the company as a developer at the end of November, I was only the fourth employee and was primarily hired because of my knowledge and experience with the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ellislab.com/codeigniter\">CodeIgniter</a> framework, which I helped build during my time at EllisLab. Two weeks ago I was promoted to VP of Engineering and have finished an expansive API foundation for the entire platform using&nbsp;<a href=\"http://laravel.com\">Laravel</a>. &nbsp;The scope of our work, even at this initial launch phase, is simply mind bending. And our list of future enhancements and features is ambitious to say the least. &nbsp;</p><p>To be frank, I took this job because my savings were so depleted after finishing the Pacific Crest Trail that any development position with enough challenge to keep me motivated would have done. Now, after helping to design and build not only the platform but the company itself, I have both an equity and personal investment in its success. There is a real chance that if the platform is successful this might be the last job I ever have. &nbsp;That is a statement I am still surprised to be uttering in public.</p><p>The scars of 2012 still haunt me every day. &nbsp;As much as part of me desires to continue the path to becoming a doctor and making the world better that way, I can no longer find the will to plunge into that level of financial and temporal debt. I lost too much faith and became too greedy for a life without that level of sacrifice. But what I can do is use all of my technical skills to help build a company whose mission statement is explicit in its goal to make things better. &nbsp;Not sure how long I will resist the call of extreme outdoor adventures, but I do not mind at least allowing the possibility of sticking around for that.</p>', '2014-05-22 03:51:03', '2015-11-10 06:47:12', '5de850f2-0fb4-4a0f-b85d-34704c7177c7'),

In a word, it was unpleasant; if we can suffer two words, it was fucking unpleasant.</p><p>Nothing like bruises, abrasions, cuts, and a partially dislocated shoulder to start the weekend. The shoulder moseyed back into position after a minute or two, wherein I got my bike functional enough to get to the ZoomCare on Alberta. Alas, they had no open appointments, but a reliable stock of ibuprofen and cleansing pads were available for purchase. A half dozen of each, a few phone calls to friends, and I was whisked home in Dave\'s stately hybrid.</p><p>The Hawthorne ZoomCare cleaned up my wounds with such a thorough scrubbing that I quickly admitted all of my past crimes and made up a few more to insure continued Congressional support. With a sling and stronger pain relievers as my companions, I scheduled an x-ray for the morning and went out for pizza. I am always a bit peckish after quarreling with composite surfaces.</p><p>Spent most of Saturday in an exhausting pain and drug fueled haze of barely contained insensibility. I have a vague recollection of switching between grumbling, napping, and watching Batman cartoons for most of Sunday. Now things are much improved.

No pull ups or pushups for a few weeks, but my lacrymal gland output remains steady.</p><p>The most frustrating part is the inopportune timing. The workload and weather had converged to finally provide me with an excellent chance of climbing Mt. Hood or spending a long day in the Gorge biking. And even with a minor case of shin splints, my stair running up Tabor was proceeding exceptionally well. Not only did the bike crash annihilate my weekend plans, but I am going to spend the next month just returning to my previous level of activity. Again.</p><p>This seems to be a repeating pattern in my life. It is a rare year in which I do not have some manner of accident or injury that incapacitates me and sets back months of work. Part of this is simply that I provide ample opportunities for the conspiring of probabilities. Spend enough time sprinting around a soccer pitch, running through the woods, or zooming down hills on a bike...and eventually you are not going to be paying attention at the right moment or get hit just right. I also have a tendency to be unforgiving in the intensity of my pursuits and also not allow sufficient time to recover.</p><p>Being intensely physical is deeply ingrained into my person; I revel in it. Yet, my psychology has not caught up with the physical reality that I am a 35 year old male with three decades of injuries on the books. Concussions, broken bones, dislocations, strains, sprains, and plenty of scar tissue. And all of that damage is not going away; I am more prone to re-injury while my ability to bounce back is no longer that of a 20 year old. It is a problem.</p><p>It is weird. I need to be careful; more deliberate and more patient. No more of the consequences be damned approach. I spend more time focusing efforts on stabilizing and preventing issues than kicking my ass. And as result of my previous assaults and offenses, parts of my body are regularly problematic when pushed too hard. It is quite a bother. I do not like it. One bit.</p><p>It is quite a hassle getting older and living with the consequences of your youth, especially when your spirit refuses to accept that either need happen at all.  At the same time, given the chance to relive my teens and twenties, I would do it all again but perhaps even harder. I feel too often that I may have taken it too easy by surviving this long.</p>', '2014-06-17 03:24:15', '2015-11-10 06:47:13', '5fe758de-e3e3-49f1-ae1c-ab531731c554'),

Plenty of research, questioning, never quite sure knowing if what you are doing is right, redoing entire sections that no longer make sense, and then presenting it to a group of people and asking \"what do you think?\" and hoping they do not toss you out. &nbsp;Stressful? Nah.</p><p>And this is just the initial launch. The platform has been public since mid-September and we already&nbsp;have a few hundred nonprofits and donors on the system. Oodles of feedback is coming in on a daily basis and plenty of areas need refinement. My To Do list has&nbsp;shifted more from large feature additions to dozens of small and medium changes required to streamline the entire process of creating projects, grants, and donations. Currently, there is only one part of the site I desperately want to tear out and start over, which is a rare thing for me. Also, a new marketing/sales team is being formed to help focus on a regional/national launch strategy, as apparently companies need to grow and bring in income (who knew?).</p><p>Still, after nine months without any time off and way too many nights and weekends working, I have a chance to take a deep breath and relax a bit. In about seven days I am taking an entire week off from both work and staring at the computer. Maybe do a few outdoor trips before the snow comes, a trip to the coast, sipping tea in coffee shops&nbsp;while reading a book, and eating <em>way</em> too many baked goods. &nbsp;Sounds nice.

Gentle reminders that many friends are buying houses, taking engagement photos, going on long romantic vacations, and settling down with a loved one or well providing manservant. Not saying that I want any of that, but it is definitely a continual reminder that relationships do exist and I have been roaming this vast and quiet desert for a while.</p><p>\r\n	Since I have resolved to stay in one place this year and eliminate a significant portion of the financial drain provided by my student loans, I have found myself in a position where pursuing a relationship is actually feasible. The usual vectors have been&nbsp;investigated: socializing in new situations,&nbsp;jumping into the world of online dating, and when leaving the house actually engaging with people and not shuttering myself in my own thoughts behind a book or computer screen.</p><p>\r\n	In the end, I think the only conclusion one can rightly draw is that Dating Sucks. Perhaps it is my analytical approach to life, but if this was a scientific experiment one would definitely question if this is the correct approach.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1064\">No significant results</a>! And yet, other people seem to pull it off. I mean, how do they do it? I do not understand! I have read their abstracts, skimmed the methods section for hints; but no, my research keeps on outputting negative results!</p><p>\"Maybe the lab equipment is faulty,\" he mutters to himself.</p><p>\r\n	Online dating seemed rather promising at first. Set out criteria, answer questions and rate them on importance, and then find matches in your area. You have conveniently eliminated the most difficult hiccups of in-person interactions–knowing if they are single and interested–while also helping to eliminate those whose characteristics you believe would not bode well for a relationship with you. And yet, wow, can you not rely on their algorithms at all when it comes to in-person chemistry. Five minutes in the real world is worth more that a week of talking online. And then there is the feeling of being on a marketplace and being forced to prioritize who you interact with first in order to prevent messy complications. The site developers have made the entire process fascinating and addictive, but in the end it seems woefully inadequate and fraught with opportunities for abuse.</p><p>In-person interactions are far more rewarding, at least initially. Eye contact, flirting, and casual conversational chemistry are genuinely fun. Ah, but then you hit the roadblocks. Oh, not single (::sigh::). Oh, not actually from Portland. Oh, does drugs. Oh, she\'s 22 (no, nope, not even). Oh, she\'s moving in two months to the other side of the country. My forehead is developing a callous from all the facepalms. To continue the science metaphor, it is like receiving amazing initial results and then finding out it was all a computer glitch. It is quite maddening. You start getting tired of going into the lab at all.</p><p>And that is just the first step. That, my friends, is just trying to get to the coveted First Date.</p><p>Maybe it is a combination of my stubborn inner child and slight bias against typical American adulthood, but when did people get so serious about their immediate futures? Is it just because we are now in our 30s? Without an ounce of exaggeration or sarcasm, I tell you I have been on a first date where I would have been greatly served by bringing a full DNA and psychological profile so my paternal potential could be efficiently evaluated. Never have I felt less a person and more a potential sperm donor. &nbsp;Why have a conversation to determine if you even like me as a person before evaluating the potential of our future offspring?</p><p>And, good lord, would I not mind talking about my thru-hike and my longing for additional adventures without the question of my continued residence in the Portland area being immediately brought up. My long term plans are unknown and I will offer no&nbsp;guarantees on a first, second, or third date that I will absolutely be around in three months. I simply do not know. It is even more ludicrous than employers not wanting to hire me when I admit I <em>might</em> want to move on in a year. I can easily fathom a half dozen realistic scenarios where I head off to another continent next year. I have been informed this has been interpreted as a fear of commitment, fear of being hurt, or a wish to play the field. A friend has even gone so far as to tell me I should lie more often about what is going on in my head. Something about how sharing all the thoughts flying through my head scares women off...or something like that, I got bored midway through the conversation. In the end, I refuse to be dishonest or misleading. While it may serve me poorly in the dating realm, it keeps my brain from throwing yet another synaptic tantrum.</p><p>All in all, the entire process is ridiculously unrelaxing. At this point I am befuddled as to how I was ever in a relationship before. It does not seem too much to ask to find a single Portland woman in her early 30s with high intelligence, a&nbsp;proclivity&nbsp;towards outdoor adventures, a working knowledge of absurd humor or science-fiction, and a willingness to enjoy the first 3-4 weeks of a relationship without requiring assurances about the future&nbsp;<strong><em>and</em></strong> with mutual attraction.</p>', '2014-10-12 18:28:40', '2015-11-10 06:47:13', '68375a58-1271-4a0f-b193-d261362209c4'),

For what, I am not entirely sure yet, but I want to be ready to have the funds available no matter what I choose to do.</p><p>In the first six weeks of 2015, I have already saved enough money to fund half a thru-hike, which is my new, favorite manner of putting money in perspective. It seems incredibly easy for me to save money and I am often surprised by how difficult it seems for others. I simply do not need very much and crave even less.  Food and shelter are the biggest expenses because I feel at a basic level they most contribute to my daily well being.  Having healthy, tasty food is one of the greatest joys in the world and with my physical pursuits it would seem silly to not put serious consideration into my eating habits.  And my spectacular, shared house is in one of my favorite parts of Portland with a very private room and a space outside it for all my dirty gear.  I could live cheaper but these expenses are worth it to me.</p><p>After that, it really peters out. I donate a percentage of my salary to nonprofits each month and then because of my physical activities I am usually buying a new piece or two of gear every single month too. Things like trail running shoes can be expensive but if you are diligent, you can usually find them for 30-50% off and buy multiple pairs at the same time. And that is more or less it. There are small expenses like maybe a book or going out to see a movie, but for the most part I just watch things online and get books from the library.

A ship that could move easily through all of time and space. Your stuff would never be in the way, it would never need to be moved to another house/apartment, and you could always have it with you. I think the answer is I would be perfectly ok with collecting and owning more things if that were the case. What bothers me about stuff is having to deal with it. It is a weight around your life and prohibits flexibility and options. Harder to move and harder to move on with it.</p><p>That is part of the romanticism of a life of travel and thru-hiking.

With my student loan payments gone and a raise this month, I have more funds available for purchases. Conviently, a number of things in my life are becoming a bit long in the tooth or will soon be at the end of their life. For example, my car is from the last century and while I did have maintenance done on it last year to insure it would keep going for another couple years, enough damage and problems have developed that it would cost more to fix it all than the car is really worth.  Further, it sure would be <em>nice</em> to have a newer car with better gas mileage and improved AWD that just so happened to have everything functioning correctly. </p><p>My bike is also over seven years old and last summer I had to replace half of its components and both wheels after my accident.

Numerous thru-hikers on Facebook are on their way to, or seriously contemplating, their next hike or adventure. Three friends in technology have expressed frustration with their current work and have started polishing their resume for entrance into the market.  And a certain redheaded baker up North is on the phone with me once a week wondering how long she will last. I myself probably consider my employment at least once a day.  I am a contemplative sort so that should not be overly surprising.\r\n</p><p>\r\n	While talking to one of those potential seekers today, I wondered if one can rightly compare employment to a relationship.  Here you spend 40+ hours a week in the company of your job.  People move across states, countries, and continents for their work. It provides some manner of fulfillment via monetary, emotional, or egotistical means. And it greatly influences nearly every major decision you will make.<br>\r\n</p><p>\r\n	Now, if you were to say to me that you are in a romantic relationship that is merely \"ok\" or \"not that great\" or \"stresses me out\", my advice would be to leave and find a new one. Your time and life are valuable–nay, precious.  Why spend a fourth of your life in a situation that you could potentially change for the better?\r\n</p><p>\r\n	Yes, yes, we do not live in a post-scarcity utopia where are ability to flutter between jobs is without restraint.  But, most of us have quite a bit of power and opportunity here, if we choose to use it.  One of my favorite quotes in this area comes from the late Steve Jobs:\r\n</p><blockquote>I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: \"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?\" And whenever the answer has been \"No\" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.</blockquote><p>That is phenomenally good advice.</p>', '2015-03-31 03:17:28', '2015-11-10 06:47:13', '497834c0-4aa2-41aa-8608-6a8af1ea511b'),

I will see what is obviously meant to be an offhand comment about an article on either Facebook or Twitter, and immediately think to myself \"Really? That can\'t be right...\"  What follows is the proverbial rabbit hole of exploration into a topic.  Thanks to Google, Wikipedia, and literally a million data sources, you can investigate an issue to your heart\'s content.  Often losing hours of a night or day trying to figure out the <em>real</em> nuances of an issue so you can <em>truly</em> understand it.\r\n</p><p>Just the other day, a friend posted a link to a Treehugger <a href=\"http://www.treehugger.com/green-food/from-lettuce-to-beef-whats-the-water-footprint-of-your-food.html\">article</a> concerning the water footprint for various food stuffs; everything from lettuce to beef to tea and coffee.  The Facebook comment about the article suggested that if we were truly serious about addressing the water crisis in California we would examine our food consumption and she pointed at meat specifically. The first thought that flew into my head was that not all foods were equal in caloric density. I think any middle school student worth their salt, if you will excuse the expression, would say unequivocally that lettuce provides fewer calories than meat.  Thus, water requirements are only the tip of the iceberg [lettuce] when it comes to scrutinizing the appropriateness of our diets in a drought.\r\n</p><p>Part of me is strictly opposed to relying on simple us vs. them points of view when expressing a voice in changing policy or personal attitudes. Nearly every important issue is nuanced enough that a single article or chart cannot help shape an effective strategy.\r\n</p><p>For example, looking at calories per gallon for various food items like beef and apples gives you another dimension to the water footprints but that means nothing if you do not know in what quantities those products are grown in California. To do that, you need to have a look at the USDA statistics for each food.  Oh, but let\'s not forget that there are different regions with different drought conditions and times of year for growing.  Wait, wait, let\'s not neglect looking into exports and imports too. Crap, one should compare all of this data for the past few years to get a bit of historical perspective.\r\n</p><p>I seriously spent two hours investigating this.  Learned that two separate experts have calculated that 10-11% of California\'s agriculture water usage is currently taken up by almonds and that we export a significant quantity of alfalfa from California to other countries so that those countries can feed it to animals for milk and meat.   Also, rediscovered how incredibly difficult it is to find, access, and evaluate data on government websites.\r\n</p><p>In the end, I am reasonably sure a panel of experts would need to do research for weeks before coming up with a real, data-supported strategy for reducing water consumption in California based on changes in the diet of American consumers.  Further, I doubt more than a few percentage of Americans would make any changes based on those recommendations.  Consumers tend to only change based on emotional and financial pressures. Sort of frustrating, but there it is. Regulations and market forces really seem to be the only full solution. Naturally, government will not move quick enough and the market will resist any changes that cut into profits.\r\n</p><p>Still. In case you are interested: going vegetarian, eating local, and creating a personal garden would not be a bad idea.\r\n</p><p><strong>Update:</strong><br>\r\n</p><p><a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/7-things-to-know-about-californias-drought/\">7 Things to Know About California\'s Drought</a> - Grist.org\r\n</p>', '2015-04-06 06:53:50', '2015-11-10 06:47:13', '9d85de37-2164-4413-abfc-0b3ac4eab670'),

Some of the berries were that distinctive dark bluish-purple that I have always considered huckleberries while others were definitely the color and shape of domesticated blueberries.  Our guide from Oregon Wild said a botanist had informed her that all of them were huckleberries. I was not exactly convinced. The leaves were very similar in shape but the branches looked different in color and the berries were obviously very different in color and somewhat in size too.</p><p>While hiking up to Old Snowy, the same thing happened.  Two similar looking plants but with obviously different berries. While absorbing the blessed fruits of the internet (mmmm, YouTube!), I decided to do a few Google searches and finally solve this mystery to my satisfaction. Not all of the links are helpful, but here was the ah-ha moment: </p><blockquote><strong>Western Huckleberries</strong><br>Like their blueberry brethren, Western huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) have five chambers in the ovary. Both the flowers and fruit look similar to blueberries, but Western huckleberries produce single berries rather than clusters, where their leaves join the stem, and bear fruit on new shoots. Huckleberries resist domestication, so they are harvested from the wild. A single plant yields less than a blueberry plant would, but each fruit contains intense flavor-causing chemicals, making it more flavorful. The black huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum) is widely harvested for its black, purple or red fruit. Cascade huckleberry\'s (Vaccinium deliciosum) bright blue berries are, as its species name suggests, delicious. Both grow in USDA zones 4 through 8. <br><br>Source: <a href=\"http://www.ehow.com/facts_5782453_difference-between-blueberries-huckleberries_.html\">ehow.com<br></a></blockquote><p>Finally having the scientific names proved extremely helpful. Wikipedia has entries on both <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinium_deliciosum\">Vaccinium deliciosum</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinium_membranaceum\">Vaccinium membranaceum</a> with photos easily found via a Google images search. The Vaccinium genus includes both berries and also the lingonberry and cranberry, of all things. According to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccinium#Taxonomy\">taxonomy section</a> on Wikipedia, there are 450 species (look at all the <a href=\"http://plants.usda.gov/java/ClassificationServlet?source=profile&amp;symbol=VACCI&amp;display=31\">kinds of berries!</a>) and genetic analysis might require a slight restructuring of this genus before too long. </p><p>So, I suppose, more or less, the mystery is solved.  They can be described as both!  Of course, from now on, I think I am just going to call one the Mountain Huckleberry and the other Cascade Blueberry.  Makes more sense in my mind and a bit more memorable too.</p>', '2015-08-01 22:22:12', '2015-11-10 06:47:13', '5abd40ef-9c72-48e8-970e-55f8f52792b8'),

I foolishly grabbed one of the tourist buses there for $10 as I did not realize it only went to the Visitor Center and the Mendenhall Lake Campground was on the other side of the lake, over an hour\'s walk away.  While walking down the road a cab came near and I hailed it down.  For $12, I skipped a 90 minute walk and was dropped off right at the West Glacier Trail trailhead.  The hike up was relatively easy and at 3.4 miles a quick scramble brought you to a nice overlook where I got a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20673078958/in/album-72157657725794351/\">few beautiful panoramas</a>. Hiking back down, I took an unmaintained, mildly rugged offshoot trail and headed down to the foot of the glacier to view the moraine and peek into a few ice caves. The day was warm and the there was a decent amount of water flowing from the caves, so I decided to play it safe and not go further in.  The weather and glacier were superb and I felt incredibly lucky to have an entire day of clear weather to explore it.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>That evening one of the hostel guests showed me photos from her whale watching tour that day. A group of humpbacks had been bubble net feeding in the area for days and it was truly a sight to behold.  Unfortunately, the next morning I discovered the whale tour I had wanted to get on had been canceled because of cruise ships leaving early and changing their tour schedules. Since backpackers are a very very small minority of the visitors in SE Alaska, the cruise ships and their schedules really do run the show. With no other plans, I consulted my handy Lonely Planet guide and discovered the Taku Glacier and Taku Lodge seaplane tour.  Within an hour I was in the copilots seat on a plane and flying towards Taku Glacier for a scenic tour of the nearby icefield and a king salmon dinner at the lodge.  It just so happened that a black bear showed up to clear the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20673100940/in/album-72157657725794351/\">drippings off of the grill</a> while we ate.  While the tour was definitely a bit pricey, I have never had such amazing views of a glacier <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20240159833/in/album-72157657725794351/\">from the air</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20834871976/in/album-72157657725794351/\">meal was exceptionally delicious</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20861150045/in/album-72157657725794351/\" title=\"Decisions, Decisions\"><img src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5676/20861150045_1006b75471_h.jpg\" alt=\"Decisions, Decisions\" style=\"max-height: 500px;\" rel=\"max-height: 500px;\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The next day I finally got on the humpback tour but had two hours until it started. Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind/rain was blowing at me in a positively abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water found its way inside along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it magically exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubble feeding, diving with flukes in the air, and even one whale breaching. There are videos on my Flickr page but they really do not do the experience justice.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20240164073/in/album-72157657725794351/\" title=\"Damp, Damp, Damp\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/742/20240164073_f5166e7a89_b.jpg\" style=\"max-height: 600px;\" rel=\"max-height: 500px;\" alt=\"Damp, Damp, Damp\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>Thanks to a ferry breaking down, another ferry not running because of severe weather, and an overcrowded hostel I bailed on Juneau a day early and took a flight to Sitka the next morning. Numerous people had expounded upon the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had hit Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new house with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me there with its hippy atmosphere; the effect made even more powerful by the \"Free\" box on the porch containing a VHS set of the first five original Star Trek movies.  On the way to the hostel I passed a community library built to resemble a TARDIS too.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The hostel did not open until 6pm, so I walked over to the <a href=\"http://www.alaskaraptor.org/\">Alaska Raptor Center</a>, which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teaches the public about Alaska\'s raptor population.  Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.  The entrance had two owls <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20238735164/in/album-72157657725794351/\">greeting visitors</a> and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds, like a Great Horned Owl. All the birds have names and classrooms around the world can \"adopt\" a bird and receive materials and lessons to learn more about raptors and conservation.  I wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20835082006/in/album-72157657725794351/\" title=\"Gavan Hill Trail - Landslide Closure\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/702/20835082006_7989960122_h.jpg\" alt=\"Gavan Hill Trail - Landslide Closure\" style=\"max-height: 500px;\" rel=\"max-height: 500px;\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The next day I had planned on going for a hike up behind Sitka to the summit of Gavan Hill.  However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the new and well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous with all the recent rain.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good condition, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail itself and even into the forest.  When the water receded, they then became trapped and died. And <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2001/011001/full/news011004-4.html\">thanks to the ichthyoid corpses</a>, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.  The smell of a healthy, thriving forest is not to be beat.  And even miles up the trail, we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn. Pretty darn incredible.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>By the end of that hike though, I definitely needed to do a bit of laundry and I finally decided that my current shoes had to go. They had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain, mud, salt water, and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even I was finding them too much.  An outfitter in town serendipitously had a nice pair of Brooks in my size for 40% off too. Travel magic, for the win.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center;\"><a data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20673312970/in/album-72157657725794351/\" title=\"Sitka Marina\"><img src=\"https://farm1.staticflickr.com/766/20673312970_c45f3ef4ae_h.jpg\" alt=\"Sitka Marina\"></a>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>The next day Sitka decided to bring out the pretty. There was a bit of rain in the morning but then sunny the rest of the day.  I grabbed my book and made the most of the day by simply lounging around town.  My tendency to go full bore meant I had not taken a single day off for the entire trip just to relax and enjoy the scenery.  Remedied that.  Saw quite a bit of wildlife too, including two <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/133323973@N07/20868579641/in/album-72157657725794351/\">sea lions having dinner</a> in the marina.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>That night I reviewed my credit card balance and decided that after an intense two week whirlwind through SE Alaska that it was time to head back south and start thinking about finding employment once more.  A truly amazing trip, highly recommended.\r\n</p>', '2015-09-20 17:18:35', '2015-11-10 06:47:13', '913ff32e-62c8-46a2-9662-e6237bebe4de'),

Honestly, considering how much I have to keep in my head for web development, it is nice when I can simplify and reduce what I need to know for getting a site up and working.  And, let\'s be honest, even with <a href=\"http://brew.sh\">Homebrew</a> setting up even anything more than a basic web development environment on a Mac was never the most relaxing task. </p><p>I recently took on a project that already had its own development setup using <a href=\"https://puphpet.com\">PuPHPet</a>, which uses Puppet and Vagrant to create the development environment.  While I have had to play with the nginx configuration and add a few items to my deploy scripts, I have not had to tinker too deeply with Homestead.  It just works.  Well...for the most part. I doubt there will ever be a piece of technology that does not give me a bit of lip service, from time to time.<br></p><p>Now with PuPHPet, I have had to actually learn how Vagrant works in a bit more detail.  Having two different VMs running has caused issues with port forwarding, for example.  Accessing MySQL through an SSH tunnel required understanding that PuPHPet was creating a new SSH key each time the machine was created.  And, if trying to log into MySQL via an SSH tunnel, you logged into SSH via the Local VM IP Address (not with localhost and the VM forwarded port).

Seems the default Diffie-Hellman parameters on nginx are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logjam_(computer_security)\">vulnerable</a> to attack.  <a href=\"https://sysops.forlaravel.com/diffie-hellman-fix\">The fix</a> is relatively simple and if you are familiar with the command line and editing via vi, you should be done in no time.  However, I wanted to insure that all of my SSL configuration options in nginx were as up to date as possible based on recommended practices too.\r\n</p><p>One of the most important configuration options you can edit is the list of ciphers your server will use and in what priority. Mozilla has a <a href=\"https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Modern_compatibility\">fantastic page</a> that explains the ciphers and has recommendations based on your compatibility needs.  Not only that, they have a <a href=\"https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/\">SSL Configuration Generator</a> where you specify your web server, currently installed version, and compatibility needs and it spits out the SSL settings it recommends all ready top copy and past. Very helpful.\r\n</p><p><strong>Pro Tip: </strong>You can find your nginx and openssl versions by running <code>nginx -v</code> and <code>openssl version</code>\r\n</p><p><strong></strong>If you\'re like me, you are probably running more than one site on Forge.  Most SSL configuration options do not need to duplicated for every site configuration file, obviously, and can be all put in the global <em>nginx.conf</em> file. Which brings us to the gzip and caching portion of our entry.\r\n</p><p>Matt Stauffer wrote a solid article on <a href=\"https://mattstauffer.co/blog/enabling-gzip-on-nginx-servers-including-laravel-forge\">how to enable gzip for your nginx server</a> by adding a couple dozen lines to your global <em>nginx.conf</em>. I followed it exactly and highly recommend you read it first.</p><p>Next, <a href=\"https://serversforhackers.com/nginx-caching/\">caching headers</a>.  This is where it got a bit tricky for me.  First, it has to go in your site configuration as you are matching files based off their file type as specified by the file name.  Second, since I am running two different applications–Laravel for the main site and <a href=\"https://craftcms.com\">Craft CMS</a> for the blog– that makes the configuration a little tricky as there are already two different <a href=\"http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#location\">location</a> blocks matching incoming requests.  You cannot simply set up a third location for just the media files as nginx will only match one location block and thus it will break things like the CSS displaying in the Craft CMS control panel.</p><p>You can get around this in two ways.  First, by having additional, more specific grep matching for your location blocks or simply add conditionals to your existing location blocks. I went with the latter.  Here is a short example of what I have in my site configuration for my combo Laravel and Craft CMS site:\r\n</p><pre>location / {\r\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;\r\n    if ($uri ~* \"\\.(?:jpg|jpeg|gif|png|ico|cur|gz|svg|svgz|mp4|ogg|ogv)\" ) {\r\n        expires 1M;\r\n        access_log off;\r\n        add_header Cache-Control \"public\";\r\n    }\r\n    if ($uri ~* \"\\.(?:css|js)\" ) {\r\n        expires 1y;\r\n        access_log off;\r\n        add_header Cache-Control \"public\";\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlocation /blog {\r\n    try_files $uri $uri/ /blog/index.php?p=$query_string;\r\n}\r\n</pre><p>Pretty simple and it works. It probably is worth emphasizing that I do not consider myself a DevOps expert and while this works for me, I am in no way putting this solution up on high as The Solution (TM, patent pending).\r\n</p><p>For everyone who read this far, here are the two example files as promised. May they be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out. Oh, and remember to first test with <code>nginx -t</code> before restarting with <code>service nginx restart</code>.\r\n</p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/reedmaniac/5e985f016c4c83d915e2\">Example Site Configuration for Laravel + Craft CMS on Forge</a><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/reedmaniac/5e985f016c4c83d915e2\"></a>\r\n</p><p><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/reedmaniac/adfa2740323d08de25bd\">nginx.conf for Laravel Forge with SSL + Gzip</a><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/reedmaniac/adfa2740323d08de25bd\"></a><br></span>\r\n</p>', '2015-12-16 04:30:11', '2015-12-16 06:01:34', '7b3c74d1-c911-4d49-b231-e59b108a6ac6'),

And, to my own surprise, I actually started keeping a record of most everything I did in that spreadsheet. I also downloaded the Strava app onto my phone to help track my runs and bike rides. While the Strava app\'s data is detailed and fascinating, I have been far less diligent with using it as I do not enjoy carrying it on shorter runs or rides when I do not have a backpack. A watch with GPS capabilities might be nice in the future.</p><p>A copy of the current spreadsheet data is below, thanks to Google Drive.  I have a Numbers document that I have been using locally the past few months but the iCloud sharing webpage is godawful slow when rendering the spreadsheet, so I just pulled my Numbers document into Google and fixed a dozen or so formatting issues. May have to switch to using Google Drive completely if I continue sharing this data publicly.  Bugger.</p><p><br></p><iframe id=\"pageswitcher-content\" frameborder=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" src=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ss-h-AqmCKR57EpAr66E6jVs_9YyvwE4_M_LebdLf_8/pubhtml?gid=509608816&single=false&widget=true&headers=false\" style=\"display: block; width: 100%; height: 500px;\">\r\n</iframe><p><br></p><p>After I made the Compiled table, I noticed a pretty substantial data oversight.  While I am keeping track of time for activities like running, biking and weights, I am completely skipping it for things like swimming, snowshoeing, and alpine touring. Swimming is easily calculable thanks to me being pretty consistent at a 30 minute mile at the moment. Alpine touring and snowshoeing would have to be educated guesses based on my remembrance of the day and any photos I took during the activity. Back of the napkin workings have me missing about 35 hours worth of time.</p><p>So, after 14 weeks, what do I see here? Apparently, I am averaging about 9.3 hours of exercise per week.   If you consider that I normally take two rest days per week and took an entire week off at the beginning of March, that means on days I exercise, I  average  two hours of activity. Not too shabby.</p><p>Comparing February and March, it is quite apparent that I slashed my running in order to start swimming and also head outside for some biking, hiking, and alpine touring.  What is not immediately apparent is that the shorter runs I did in March were done a bit faster, resulting in me pulling off an 8:30/mile pace during a trail run today, which is a minute faster than my average time in February.</p><p>One rather embarrassing statistic is my time spent stretching. 460 minutes in January, 295 minutes in February, but only 85 minutes in March. Not a good trend. Need to work on that in April.</p><p>Is it worth having this information? I suppose it really depends on my aims for all of this activity.  I call it training but I am not really training for anything in particular.  I would not mind finally running all of Wildwood in one go and I do have a dream of climbing both Mt. Hood and Mt. Adams in one day (why? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqR_p_KFNsw\">fortune and glory, kid, fortune and glory</a>).  Neither of those two things are really motivating me to head out though and swimming is not exactly helpful with mountaineering, I suspect.  Honestly, I simply like knowing that I am in shape enough to handle nearly any activity I can throw at my body.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</p><p>Going to keep on tracking though, maybe add a few more columns in for things like pace and power output. Also considering a heart rate monitor as it is all the rage now for serious athletic training and I am a bit curious to know what that cold, dark cinder in my chest is doing while I am headed up yet another hill.</p><p><em>––</em></p><p><em>Later: </em>While walking back from Palio tonight (1.5 miles from the house), it occurred to me that I made no mention of all the walking I do. Looking at my iPhone\'s Health app, it looks like I average around 2.5 miles of walking every single day. Today alone I walked 8 miles during my travels to food carts and tea/coffee shops.  I do not really consider this exercise per se, instead it is a key part of my recovery strategy.  Walking helps loosen up my body after strenuous activity and it also helps me mentally relax, especially on these beautiful spring days.  I definitely think it contributes to how well my body puts up with the strain I put on it.<br></p>', '2016-04-09 21:26:25', '2016-04-10 06:05:53', 'de7aa0b2-ca03-4e5a-99d2-7f4cdf5c08f1'),
 ('236', '224', 'en_us', 'Print Worthy Photos from Mt. Hood', '<p>Three weeks ago, after a night of revelry in celebration of a friend\'s birthday, I got up early on Friday and drove to Mt. Hood for a solo ski up to the top of Palmer Glacier. This winter has seen a complete reversal of our snow fortunes compared to last year, so the mountain was beautifully covered. The snow was quite hard and the temperatures a bit biting, but the wind was completely absent (a rare thing).  It was gorgeous in that way only a quiet mountain in mid-winter can be.  There is something about the austere colors and the quality of the air that adds a sharpness which makes me ache for these kind of views.\r\n</p><p>Thanks to upgrading my iPhone to the newest version in early February, the camera I had on me took some stunning photos.  I suspect they might even be print quality.  So, I uploaded two of my favorites to Flickr for anyone and everyone to see and use.

 ('237', '225', 'en_us', 'Strava Wars - The Search for More Data', '<p>A year ago, when I switched from training for a 50K trail run to training to bike 100+ miles for <a href=\"http://www.reachthebeach.org/\">Reach the Beach</a>, I finally downloaded the Strava app for my iPhone.  At the periphery of my knowledge, I knew the app existed and that multiple professional athletes used it to publicly share their training, but for a long time it seemed a bit more serious than I was willing to be, just like my <a href=\"https://reedmaniac.com/blog/entries/2016-activity-log\">training log</a>.</p><p>Curiosity got the better of me though and I wondered how fast I was flying down some of those hills in the West Hills or in the Columbia Gorge. And yes, I craved a bit of bragging rights too. My profile is located <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/3769422\">here</a>.  As you can see my usage is a bit sporadic. Entire months and multiple weeks have no data, despite them being in the middle of prime  running or biking season.  What can I say, I am inconsistent. While I love my phone, I have a tendency to ignore it as a computer device as it seems silly to be so consistently connected to the world when you are Outside™.   More than a few rides have ended and I discovered much to my chagrin that I had not started Strava at all.  One of those fancy GPS-enabled watches would likely help, but I have not bit that bullet yet.</p><p>As far as the data Strava provides post-run or post-ride, it is quite a bit of fun to see what my average speed is, the elevation gained, and what my mile times are for various sections of my run or ride.  Just recently, during a downhill section on Newberry Rd., I apparently hit a maximum speed of <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/538796948\">51.7mi/h</a>.  And during a trail run this past week, I was running half my miles at <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/544625411\">8 minutes or under</a>.  That is pretty darn fast on both accounts. I am a tiny bit impressed with myself. It makes me think that this more structured approached to training is providing real results. That is a positive feeling.\r\n</p><p>However. The data is not entirely reliable. My trail running takes place primarily in Forest Park where there is a copious amount of trees and more than a few ravines, which regularly interrupt GPS or lessen its accuracy.  The trail run I did this past week is a whopper of an example.\r\n</p><p><img src=\"{asset:226:url}\">\r\n</p><p>\r\nAs you can see the route Strava thinks I followed deviates a non-trivial amount from the actual trail.  Then, you can see in the upper left that it seems to draw a line straight across the map to another point. Seems Strava completely lost signal for about 20 minutes and did not track any of my running past that last point in the upper left.  Did not regain signal until I was almost a mile back. I think this is the second or third time such a huge \"break\" has occurred on a trail run. Biking is typically much better with its data, since it is on a road with a clearer signal from the GPS. Still, I have definitely seen a few cases where because of speed or conditions, a jump or two has happened during a turn or in a valley.</p><p>Strava also has what it calls a Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP) speed, which they describe as an estimate of what your pace would have been if you had been running on flat land, opposed to a grade.  I am sure there is some solid research and math behind their calculations, but for my first mile last Wednesday I ran a 7:25 pace.  Strava informed me that my GAP pace would have been 5:55. Um, I think not. Pretty sure you could put me on a flat mile with a decent tail wind and I would not even come close to a sub-6 minute mile. It\'s a fun thought but I am certainly not taking that GAP pace seriously anytime soon.</p><p>Finally, Strava has \"segments\" where you can compare yourself against other athletes who have done a similar route. Stirs up one\'s competitive side, which is not a bad thing. Most of the time I fall pretty square in the top 10-12% percentile of people who use Strava.  Every so often I take a look at the top athletes for a segment and notice oddities.  For a segment I did during yesterday\'s right, most of the top 10% people were doing a 22-25mph pace. The top athlete though? 43mph. Hm. I may be wrong but I have serious doubts that pace is accurate.</p><p>These segments also do not take into account conditions either, so you have to be mindful that your pace for a segment done in winter while running 15 miles will definitely be slower than an athlete who did that segment in summer while only running 6 miles.  Is it really <em>that</em><span class=\"redactor-invisible-space\"> important? No, not really.  But, if the data and statistics are there, you should understand their faults and adjust your expectations accordingly.</span></p><p>Overall, I enjoy Strava because I can regularly evaluate my baseline and progress during my training. I am definitely getting faster overall.  Yet, on days when I feel tired, my pace definitely suffers. When I do 2 or 3 moderate to hard days in a row, the final day is usually the slowest in whatever activity I am doing. Not always though, which forces me to acknowledge the strong effect that rest, hydration, and nutrition have on my performance.  Strava validates the power of data in training. Further, it is planting the idea firmly in my noggin\' that if I wish to strive for even more performance I need to seriously consider tracking more data, such as heart rate and caloric intake pre, during, and post exercise.</p>', '2016-04-17 19:50:14', '2016-04-17 20:44:22', '122522e9-95f2-43e8-8d90-4d84ed8057cb'),

I also included links to the product\'s website, Amazon, and REI to help readers get a range of information and reviews. &nbsp;That being said, I shopped around and found quite a number of discounts from the likes of <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.geartrade.com\\\">GearTrade<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/backcountry.com\\\">Backcountry.com<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/ebay.com\\\">eBay<\\/a>, and <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.sierratradingpost.com\\\">Sierra Trading Post<\\/a>. &nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;the prices listed at those sites will likely not match my \\\"purchased cost\\\" for each item.<\\/p><p>Despite having quite a plethora of gear already, unfortunately most of it is meant for activities like mountaineering and snow camping. &nbsp;Not exactly lightweight. &nbsp;So, I bit the bullet and bought new, ultralight versions of a shelter, sleeping bag\\/pad, and pack for a rather hefty cost of $995. &nbsp;Yet, by buying those four items instead of using what I already owned, I reduced my base pack weight by over five pounds. &nbsp;Considering the time and distance, I felt that was a worthwhile investment.&nbsp;After the big four, my next four largest purchases were a JetBoil Sol Titanium stove, a solar charger, and my hiking shirt and pants.<\\/p><p>JetBoil Sol Titanium. &nbsp;While it seems the hip\\/cool ultralight PCT backpacker uses an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/jwbasecamp.com\\/Articles\\/SuperCat\\/\\\">alcohol stove<\\/a>, I simply could not get excited about using one. I know that when I cook while backpacking, I am usually about one evolutionary leap away from caveman and want my food <i><b>now<\\/b><\\/i>. Also did not like having to concern myself with alcohol measuring, the lack of simmering, and instability. &nbsp;This new JetBoil&nbsp;boils 2 cups of water in about a minute, which is the perfect amount of water for most of my dinners, while a fuel cannister should last around two weeks. &nbsp;Doubt I will regret this decision.<\\/p><p>Solar Charger. We are in the age of technology. Our smartphones are camera, GPS, web browser, app platform, and phone all in one. &nbsp;The&nbsp;sCharger-5 Solar Charger is hopefully going to help me keep my iPhone powered. It was highly recommended by a few PCT hikers last year and my initial tests have shown it to be quite the little power delivery device when there is full sun.<span><br><\\/span><\\/p><p>Hiking Shirt and Bottom. &nbsp;I am not sure where I initially heard about <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.railriders.com\\\">RailRiders<\\/a>, but the more I read the more it looked like their clothes would be ideal for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. &nbsp;Lightweight, ventilated, quick drying, and long lasting. &nbsp;One of my more blind faith gear choices, but sometimes you need to rely on a good feeling and

I also included links to the product\'s website, Amazon, and REI to help readers get a range of information and reviews. &nbsp;That being said, I shopped around and found quite a number of discounts from the likes of <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.geartrade.com\\\">GearTrade<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/backcountry.com\\\">Backcountry.com<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/ebay.com\\\">eBay<\\/a>, and <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.sierratradingpost.com\\\">Sierra Trading Post<\\/a>. &nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;the prices listed at those sites will likely not match my \\\"purchased cost\\\" for each item.<\\/p><p>Despite having quite a plethora of gear already, unfortunately most of it is meant for activities like mountaineering and snow camping. &nbsp;Not exactly lightweight. &nbsp;So, I bit the bullet and bought new, ultralight versions of a shelter, sleeping bag\\/pad, and pack for a rather hefty cost of $995. &nbsp;Yet, by buying those four items instead of using what I already owned, I reduced my base pack weight by over five pounds. &nbsp;Considering the time and distance, I felt that was a worthwhile investment.&nbsp;After the big four, my next four largest purchases were a JetBoil Sol Titanium stove, a solar charger, and my hiking shirt and pants.<\\/p><p>JetBoil Sol Titanium. &nbsp;While it seems the hip\\/cool ultralight PCT backpacker uses an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/jwbasecamp.com\\/Articles\\/SuperCat\\/\\\">alcohol stove<\\/a>, I simply could not get excited about using one. I know that when I cook while backpacking, I am usually about one evolutionary leap away from caveman and want my food <i><b>now<\\/b><\\/i>. Also did not like having to concern myself with alcohol measuring, the lack of simmering, and instability. &nbsp;This new JetBoil&nbsp;boils 2 cups of water in about a minute, which is the perfect amount of water for most of my dinners, while a fuel cannister should last around two weeks. &nbsp;Doubt I will regret this decision.<\\/p><p>Solar Charger. We are in the age of technology. Our smartphones are camera, GPS, web browser, app platform, and phone all in one. &nbsp;The&nbsp;sCharger-5 Solar Charger is hopefully going to help me keep my iPhone powered. It was highly recommended by a few PCT hikers last year and my initial tests have shown it to be quite the little power delivery device when there is full sun.<span><br><\\/span><\\/p><p>Hiking Shirt and Bottom. &nbsp;I am not sure where I initially heard about <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.railriders.com\\\">RailRiders<\\/a>, but the more I read the more it looked like their clothes would be ideal for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. &nbsp;Lightweight, ventilated, quick drying, and long lasting. &nbsp;One of my more blind faith gear choices, but sometimes you need to rely on a good feeling and hope it turns out to be right.<\\/p><p>Everything else is reasonably standard or self explanatory. &nbsp;I am sure with more money<i>,<\\/i>&nbsp;research<i>, and<\\/i>&nbsp;sacrificing of comfort, I could reduce my base weight another 3 pounds and perhaps even have found cheaper items. &nbsp;But, for now I am reasonably content with my choices. &nbsp;We shall see how foolish I truly am once on

I also included links to the product\'s website, Amazon, and REI to help readers get a range of information and reviews. &nbsp;That being said, I shopped around and found quite a number of discounts from the likes of <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.geartrade.com\\\">GearTrade<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/backcountry.com\\\">Backcountry.com<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/ebay.com\\\">eBay<\\/a>, and <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.sierratradingpost.com\\\">Sierra Trading Post<\\/a>. &nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;the prices listed at those sites will likely not match my \\\"purchased cost\\\" for each item.<\\/p><p>Despite having quite a plethora of gear already, unfortunately most of it is meant for activities like mountaineering and snow camping. &nbsp;Not exactly lightweight. &nbsp;So, I bit the bullet and bought new, ultralight versions of a shelter, sleeping bag\\/pad, and pack for a rather hefty cost of $995. &nbsp;Yet, by buying those four items instead of using what I already owned, I reduced my base pack weight by over five pounds. &nbsp;Considering the time and distance, I felt that was a worthwhile investment.&nbsp;After the big four, my next four largest purchases were a JetBoil Sol Titanium stove, a solar charger, and my hiking shirt and pants.<\\/p><p>JetBoil Sol Titanium. &nbsp;While it seems the hip\\/cool ultralight PCT backpacker uses an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/jwbasecamp.com\\/Articles\\/SuperCat\\/\\\">alcohol stove<\\/a>, I simply could not get excited about using one. I know that when I cook while backpacking, I am usually about one evolutionary leap away from caveman and want my food <i><b>now<\\/b><\\/i>. Also did not like having to concern myself with alcohol measuring, the lack of simmering, and instability. &nbsp;This new JetBoil&nbsp;boils 2 cups of water in about a minute, which is the perfect amount of water for most of my dinners, while a fuel cannister should last around two weeks. &nbsp;Doubt I will regret this decision.<\\/p><p>Solar Charger. We are in the age of technology. Our smartphones are camera, GPS, web browser, app platform, and phone all in one. &nbsp;The&nbsp;sCharger-5 Solar Charger is hopefully going to help me keep my iPhone powered. It was highly recommended by a few PCT hikers last year and my initial tests have shown it to be quite the little power delivery device when there is full sun.<span><br><\\/span><\\/p><p>Hiking Shirt and Bottom. &nbsp;I am not sure where I initially heard about <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.railriders.com\\\">RailRiders<\\/a>, but the more I read the more it looked like their clothes would be ideal for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. &nbsp;Lightweight, ventilated, quick drying, and long lasting. &nbsp;One of my more blind faith gear choices, but sometimes you need to rely on a good feeling and hope it turns out to be right.<\\/p><p>Everything else is reasonably standard or self explanatory. &nbsp;I am sure with more money<i>,<\\/i>&nbsp;research<i>, and<\\/i>&nbsp;sacrificing of comfort, I could reduce my base weight another 3 pounds and perhaps even have found cheaper items. &nbsp;But, for now I am reasonably content with my choices. &nbsp;We shall see how foolish I truly am once on

I also included links to the product\'s website, Amazon, and REI to help readers get a range of information and reviews. &nbsp;That being said, I shopped around and found quite a number of discounts from the likes of <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.geartrade.com\\\">GearTrade<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/backcountry.com\\\">Backcountry.com<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/ebay.com\\\">eBay<\\/a>, and <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.sierratradingpost.com\\\">Sierra Trading Post<\\/a>. &nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;the prices listed at those sites will likely not match my \\\"purchased cost\\\" for each item.<\\/p><p>Despite having quite a plethora of gear already, unfortunately most of it is meant for activities like mountaineering and snow camping. &nbsp;Not exactly lightweight. &nbsp;So, I bit the bullet and bought new, ultralight versions of a shelter, sleeping bag\\/pad, and pack for a rather hefty cost of $995. &nbsp;Yet, by buying those four items instead of using what I already owned, I reduced my base pack weight by over five pounds. &nbsp;Considering the time and distance, I felt that was a worthwhile investment.&nbsp;After the big four, my next four largest purchases were a JetBoil Sol Titanium stove, a solar charger, and my hiking shirt and pants.<\\/p><p>JetBoil Sol Titanium. &nbsp;While it seems the hip\\/cool ultralight PCT backpacker uses an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/jwbasecamp.com\\/Articles\\/SuperCat\\/\\\">alcohol stove<\\/a>, I simply could not get excited about using one. I know that when I cook while backpacking, I am usually about one evolutionary leap away from caveman and want my food <i><b>now<\\/b><\\/i>. Also did not like having to concern myself with alcohol measuring, the lack of simmering, and instability. &nbsp;This new JetBoil&nbsp;boils 2 cups of water in about a minute, which is the perfect amount of water for most of my dinners, while a fuel cannister should last around two weeks. &nbsp;Doubt I will regret this decision.<\\/p><p>Solar Charger. We are in the age of technology. Our smartphones are camera, GPS, web browser, app platform, and phone all in one. &nbsp;The&nbsp;sCharger-5 Solar Charger is hopefully going to help me keep my iPhone powered. It was highly recommended by a few PCT hikers last year and my initial tests have shown it to be quite the little power delivery device when there is full sun.<span><br><\\/span><\\/p><p>Hiking Shirt and Bottom. &nbsp;I am not sure where I initially heard about <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.railriders.com\\\">RailRiders<\\/a>, but the more I read the more it looked like their clothes would be ideal for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. &nbsp;Lightweight, ventilated, quick drying, and long lasting. &nbsp;One of my more blind faith gear choices, but sometimes you need to rely on a good feeling and hope it turns out to be right.<\\/p><p>Everything else is reasonably standard or self explanatory. &nbsp;I am sure with more money<i>,<\\/i>&nbsp;research<i>, and<\\/i>&nbsp;sacrificing of comfort, I could reduce my base weight another 3 pounds and perhaps even have found cheaper items. &nbsp;But, for now I am reasonably content with my choices. &nbsp;We shall see how foolish I truly am once on

I also included links to the product\'s website, Amazon, and REI to help readers get a range of information and reviews. &nbsp;That being said, I shopped around and found quite a number of discounts from the likes of <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.geartrade.com\\\">GearTrade<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/backcountry.com\\\">Backcountry.com<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/ebay.com\\\">eBay<\\/a>, and <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.sierratradingpost.com\\\">Sierra Trading Post<\\/a>. &nbsp;Thus,&nbsp;the prices listed at those sites will likely not match my \\\"purchased cost\\\" for each item.<\\/p><p>Despite having quite a plethora of gear already, unfortunately most of it is meant for activities like mountaineering and snow camping. &nbsp;Not exactly lightweight. &nbsp;So, I bit the bullet and bought new, ultralight versions of a shelter, sleeping bag\\/pad, and pack for a rather hefty cost of $995. &nbsp;Yet, by buying those four items instead of using what I already owned, I reduced my base pack weight by over five pounds. &nbsp;Considering the time and distance, I felt that was a worthwhile investment.&nbsp;After the big four, my next four largest purchases were a JetBoil Sol Titanium stove, a solar charger, and my hiking shirt and pants.<\\/p><p>JetBoil Sol Titanium. &nbsp;While it seems the hip\\/cool ultralight PCT backpacker uses an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/jwbasecamp.com\\/Articles\\/SuperCat\\/\\\">alcohol stove<\\/a>, I simply could not get excited about using one. I know that when I cook while backpacking, I am usually about one evolutionary leap away from caveman and want my food <i><b>now<\\/b><\\/i>. Also did not like having to concern myself with alcohol measuring, the lack of simmering, and instability. &nbsp;This new JetBoil&nbsp;boils 2 cups of water in about a minute, which is the perfect amount of water for most of my dinners, while a fuel cannister should last around two weeks. &nbsp;Doubt I will regret this decision.<\\/p><p>Solar Charger. We are in the age of technology. Our smartphones are camera, GPS, web browser, app platform, and phone all in one. &nbsp;The&nbsp;sCharger-5 Solar Charger is hopefully going to help me keep my iPhone powered. It was highly recommended by a few PCT hikers last year and my initial tests have shown it to be quite the little power delivery device when there is full sun.<span><br><\\/span><\\/p><p>Hiking Shirt and Bottom. &nbsp;I am not sure where I initially heard about <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.railriders.com\\\">RailRiders<\\/a>, but the more I read the more it looked like their clothes would be ideal for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail. &nbsp;Lightweight, ventilated, quick drying, and long lasting. &nbsp;One of my more blind faith gear choices, but sometimes you need to rely on a good feeling and hope it turns out to be right.<\\/p><p>Everything else is reasonably standard or self explanatory. &nbsp;I am sure with more money<i>,<\\/i>&nbsp;research<i>, and<\\/i>&nbsp;sacrificing of comfort, I could reduce my base weight another 3 pounds and perhaps even have found cheaper items. &nbsp;But, for now I am reasonably content with my choices. &nbsp;We shall see how foolish I truly am once on

This training insured all of my <i>urban<\\/i> EMT skills were up to snuff. &nbsp;March and April were a busy couple months as I was working full time and training\\/planning for the PCT too. &nbsp;But, all of the required paperwork and signatures were sent off a few weeks ago so I am not yet recertified but I am certifiable, again.<\\/p><p>With all of this training, knowledge, and experience building a lightweight first aid kit for a 2,600+ mile hike is a Herculean battle between two opposing desires. &nbsp;How much weight is too much vs. what items are worth the weight given my skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I led outdoor trips, most organization-provided first aid kits that were around 5 pounds and were one lawyer recommendation away from containing an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Automated_external_defibrillator\\\">AED<\\/a>. &nbsp;On my own backpacking trips I usually have a first aid kit between a pound to a pound and a half that is meant to prevent an uncomfortable or problematic situation from becoming a <em>really <\\/em>bad day.<\\/p><p>Amelia commented when she saw my completed kit that I built this PCT first aid kit not for me but for everyone else on the trail, despite the fact that I do not particularly like most people and head into the wilderness to escape civilization. I am funny like that.<\\/p><p>Since the PCT crosses many towns, roads, and campsites, there will be both urban and wilderness medical situations possible. &nbsp;The balance I tried to strike was between light and capable of handling the most likely scenarios, while not regretting what I could have carried but did not for weight reasons. &nbsp;Tough. &nbsp;And like all things, I will likely adjust it on the way.<\\/p><p>The kit includes the following:&nbsp;Ace bandage, gauze roll, athletic tape, NSAID pain relievers, gloves + CPR face shield, moleskin, tweezers, pins, Benadryl, backup water purification tablets, QuikClot, triangle bandage, SecondSkin blister pads, bandaids, gauze pads. All for only <b>9.5 oz<\\/b> total, which is about the weight of 1.2 cups of water. &nbsp;<\\/p><p><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/reedmaniac\\/8662219110\\/\\\"><img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/farm9.staticflickr.com\\/8266\\/8662219110_e3efc59a35_z.jpg\\\" style=\\\"\\\"><\\/a><\\/p><p>The majority of the what I have treated in the backcountry are blisters and musculoskeletal injuries &nbsp;There have been a few decent bleeds and cuts but nothing that a bit of gauze and tape cannot handle. &nbsp;So, I went with a half dozen blister pads, enough gauze to handle a few decent bleeds, and ace bandage + triangle bandage. &nbsp;Sure I could improvise something for the ace bandage or triangle bandage, but I have yet to meet a trained professional who would not greatly prefer to have it provided. &nbsp;Tape, pain relievers, tweezers, pins, and allergy meds are all lightweight, handy, and are pretty hard to improvise. &nbsp;Ever tried to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/wwwchem.csustan.edu\\/consumer\\/aspirincons\\/aspirincons.htm\\\">synthesize aspirin<\\/a> in the wilderness?

Simply is not a big enough screen with the keyboard to make writing enjoyable. One of those times when I wonder how an iPad Mini would hold up. &nbsp;For the most part, I am writing these blog posts whenever I get to a town that has a library. Alas, library internet is not overly fast and all the computers are using an old version of Internet Explorer by default. &nbsp;So, I have been downloading Chrome to make the whole writing situation more palatable. &nbsp;That takes a while with the connection speed and then in no time my time is up. &nbsp;Thus, these entries are written quickly and with very little proof reading. &nbsp;Anyhoo...here are a few updates regarding the gear I have been using.<\\/p><p><b>Tarptent Contrail.<\\/b><\\/p><p>With such a lightweight and seemingly easy setup, I really thought I would love this tent for my first attempts at both doing a thru-hike and going ultralight. &nbsp;Alas, no. &nbsp;The desert regions have had rather strong winds and at times difficult ground (too hard, too sandy). Since the tent is not freestanding, it has been extremely difficult making it robust enough to survive a night of high winds. &nbsp;At Whitewater Creek, when the front containing a thunderstorm started coming in, my tent collapsed twice, despite staking it AND using a copious amount of rocks to reinforce the stakes. &nbsp;When you stop wanting to set up your tent at all and just cowboy camp every night, that is a problem. So, I threw in the towel and have ordered a new tent, Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1, from REI. &nbsp;It is a bit heavier, but it is freestanding and has been praised by other hikers on the trail.<\\/p><p><b>Brooks Cascadia 8 Shoes.<\\/b><\\/p><p>Love these shoes. &nbsp;When I was testing shoes prior to the hiker, I always seemed to get sore feet after 8 or 10 miles. Not with these. &nbsp;I have done a 28 mile day in the desert heat and my feet were not sore afterwards. They may not be able to survive as much punishment as more dedicated hiking shoes though. &nbsp;Around mile 340, I noticed that the tread was loose and there were tiny holes where the end of my pinky toe ends. &nbsp;Thankfully, at Cajon Junction, a fellow hiker, Dingo, rented a car and we took a trip to REI (two hour trip because of a brush fire that closed the interstate and caused a massive traffic snarl).<\\/p><p>REI, to their credit, replaced the shoes but with a stern look and voice informing me that these shoes were not meant for this manner of activity. &nbsp;We shall see if this pair survives the next 300-500 miles or if the PCT abuses it too much. &nbsp;Even if I have to replace them every 350 miles, I think I will stick with them, they are simply too light and comfortable.<\\/p><p><b>Gossamer Gear Mariposa Backpack<\\/b>.<\\/p><p>Solid. &nbsp;Light, perfect size, and so far standing up to the abuse. &nbsp;I have put one hole into its big mesh pocket, but that was a sharp trekking pole. &nbsp;One of the hip pouch zippers seems to be coming loose, but I think I can fix that up without any problem. &nbsp;The removal sit pad is genius. &nbsp;I had my doubts, but I use it multiple times a day.<\\/p><p><b>ZPacks 900 Fill Power Down, 20 degree Sleeping Bag.<\\/b><br><\\/p><p>This one is tough. While up at Coon Creek Cabin, at over 8000 feet, the temperature dropped to at least 15 degrees Fahrenheit. I was perfectly cozy in this bag with my long underwear on and a hat. &nbsp;However, on those nights when the desert only cools to a balmy 58 degrees Fahrenheit, this bag is much much too warm. &nbsp;After hiking 20+ miles and eating a solid dinner, my legs seem to radiate ungodly amounts of heat. &nbsp;I have taken to putting on my sleeping clothes and using the sleeping bag as a blanket only for my top. &nbsp;This is not really the fault of the bag, but I do miss having a full length zipper so I can better free my legs to the night air while keeping my torso comfortable.<\\/p><p><b>Sawyer Squeeze Water Filter.<\\/b><\\/p><p><font face=\\\"sans-serif\\\">This filter works well. &nbsp;It works really well. Having seen how much people love the inline Sawyer filter for their CamelBaks is having me contemplating a switch. &nbsp;It only takes probably 5-7 minutes to make all the water I will need for a long stretch, but it is not as convenient as simply being able to empty the water into your hydration bladder and go. &nbsp;No worries, virtually no effort. &nbsp;Hard to not desire that a bit. &nbsp;The REI we went to from Cajon Junction did not have the inline adapter in stock, but if I see it later on I might impulse buy it.<\\/font><\\/p><p><font face=\\\"sans-serif\\\"><b>KEEN Socks.<\\/b><\\/font><\\/p><p><font face=\\\"sans-serif\\\">More details about this will come a bit later. &nbsp;The Smartwool socks I started with did not survive much past two weeks; holes in the heels.

Despite the trail being graded for horses and there being an organization behind its upkeep, traipsing along it requires a certain amount of concentration. &nbsp;Rocks, roots, cliff edges, poison oak, poodle dog bush, stream crossings, et cetera. &nbsp;Throw in a pack that is averaging 28 pounds, two hiking poles to manage, and days of 20+ miles...and you have a recipe for a consistent need to focus.<\\/p><p>At the end of the day you are usually so tired, you simply want food, bed, and maybe a bit of relaxation, which for hikers seems to be either smoking, drinking, TV watching, or for a select few it is reading a book. &nbsp;I just finished my fifth book and have spent an entire town afternoon in the library, so I think we know what camp I belong to.<\\/p><p>Yet, saying all that, I <i>have <\\/i>had time to think.

while I have been rather more leisurely about my preparations. \\u00a0Steps were mapped out in my mind, of course. \\u00a0I perused gear reviews and blog entries in my off hours, bookmarked webpages, created a spreadsheet for gear costs and weights, and set money aside for purchases. \\u00a0 Yet,\\u00a0it was not until the beginning of March that my relative languid behavior disappeared and I started seriously concentrating on the task before me.<\\/p><p>All the gear except a few middling items have now been purchased. \\u00a0I am still waiting for a shirt and a stove to appear on my doorstep from the USPS fairy (I have yet to actually\\u00a0<i>see<\\/i>\\u00a0our mailman), but all other incidental items can likely be procured in a single afternoon. \\u00a0 A significant pile of dried meals has been ordered from <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/outdoorherbivore.com\\\">Outdoor Herbivore<\\/a> and will be allocated to specific resupply boxes later this week. \\u00a0Plane tickets are purchased and sleeping quarters arranged in San Diego for the night before the hike starts.<\\/p><p>Yup. \\u00a0All coming together.<\\/p><p>The planning and preparations never really concerned me as much as they did Amelia. \\u00a0Much of my formative years were spent exploring forests and I have extensive backpacking experience from previous trips. \\u00a0Ultralight backpacking is reasonably new to me, but I have always been careful to choose the best gear for my outdoor activities, which has helped me have a pack weight that is significantly less than people who are still using packs purchased in the 80s. \\u00a0As a man whose metabolism still burns fiercely, food intake to me is as much about fuel as taste so I will eat almost anything put in front of me. \\u00a0 While my concern for all these things is not exactly lighthearted, it borders a bit on laissez-faire. \\u00a0We shall just see how the gear and food goes, no?<\\/p><p>What is on my mind is the reliability of my body. \\u00a0Last year at this time is when Amelia visited me in Portland after her stint in Antarctica and trip around New Zealand. \\u00a0She told me the other day that what she remembers of that visit is me still limping and becoming tired after walking just a mile. \\u00a010 months ago I was still scared of uneven ground for fear my knee would collapse on me. \\u00a06 months ago is when I went for my first 2 minute jog. \\u00a03 months ago, I snowshoed up solo to a remote fire lookout. \\u00a0A month ago I finally did a trail run that lasted over an hour (full disclosure: very sore afterwards). \\u00a0 And, right now I am rotating between days of walking 6-8 miles or spending two hours in the gym doing weights, rowing, and stationary biking.<\\/p><p>My knee will never be 100% again, I understand that. \\u00a0As my physical therapist joked, I no longer have original factory parts. \\u00a0I tore it up pretty bad and it will never be completely reliable. \\u00a0Rubbing the scar tissue in my tendon has become somewhat habit forming. \\u00a0But, in the past year I have worked desperately to restore as much strength and functionality as possible. \\u00a0Strong enough to <i>attempt<\\/i> a 2,600 mile backpacking trip. \\u00a0Not strong enough to feel remotely certain of finishing.<\\/p><p>In all fairness, I am giving myself even odds of making it through the first month. \\u00a0Even disregarding the knee, I have not treated my body gently these past three decades. \\u00a0Years of soccer, running, backpacking, mountaineering, and shenanigans have taken a toll. \\u00a0It has been a well lived life, in my opinion, but I am now starting to deal with the complications of that hard playing. \\u00a0Lots of muscles, tendons, and ligaments are infused with scar tissue. \\u00a0Backpacking 2,600 miles is not going to treat them kindly.<\\/p><p>And yet, why the hell not try.<span><br><\\/span><\\/p><blockquote>\\\"Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure, than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.\\\"<\\/blockquote><p><\\/p><p><\\/p>\\r\\n\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2013-05-26 15:50:49', '2015-01-17 19:43:04', 'f938f51b-7d35-499e-aa26-932af3b44e32'),

I have not posted in two months! Not since Tuolumne Meadows! And now I am sitting at my friend Dave\'s house in Portland, where I will be leading a backpacking trip for Reed College starting tomorrow morning.  Yes, that\'s right, I got off the Pacific Crest Trail to lead a backpacking trip.  Everyone seems to find that mildly amusing.  The timing just worked out so perfectly and I enjoy leading Reedies into the wilderness so much that it was awfully hard to say no.

Nice!\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t  So, the last two months were intense and long. Goodall and I made it through the Sierras tired but mostly intact.  Her parents met us again at Sonora Pass and gave us a tasty dinner and took the unwieldy bear canisters away.  Then, we entered what must have been the birthplace of the first mosquitos, as they were there in force.  Entire flocks followed us for days.  Headnets and DEET not optional.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t Finally, we entered Northern California where we enjoyed many days of temperatures near 100 degrees Fahrenheit and plenty of volcanic rocks through old burn areas.  It had more than its fair share of unpleasant days. Upon finishing the 30+ dry stretch that is Hat Creek Rim, I remember looking at two fellow hikers, Lotus and Hermes, and we all just looked completely spent.

Your days are spent focusing on getting the miles done, feeding yourself, resting, recovering, and finding the will power to do it all again the next day. No doubt it is monotonous, even with the glorious terrain and immense ecosystems we have crossed.  And yet, for these past five months, it was a purer life.

After a quick photo in the cold rain and a signing of the register hidden in Monument 78, I promptly continued on hiking an additional eight miles to the road nearing Manning Park where Goodall\'s parents whisked us away to a quick shower with clean clothes, a delicious meal, and a four hour ride back across the border (via roads this time) and home to Whidbey Island.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tNot exactly the smooth cruise to the finish we were expecting. In fact, it was the most difficult and dangerous part of the entire trip.  Started with a raging thunderstorm the first night out of Steven\'s Pass followed by three days of being constantly soaked in freezing rain and staying borderline hypothermic. The day we hiked into High Bridge for the bus into Stehekin, we had a surprisingly dry and warm day.  After a night at the lodge, we headed out for a lovely autumn scented day and camped above Rainy Pass. Next morning, the freezing rain returned and for the next two days the weather cycled between cold, rain, and snow while we crossed multiple washouts on ridges; some of which were 15\' deep and required climbing up and down loose, slick rock. Our last night on the trail, we got three inches of snow and tracked the last six miles to the monument through puddles of freezing water.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tBut we made it. And just in time. Here we are only about five days later and the Pacific Northwest is getting hammered with another winter storm.  1-2 feet of snow and high winds are forecasted for that last section. Most hikers still on the trail are quitting or buckling down for a few days. Winter is definitely here and hiking season is reaching a quick close.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tNow that I am done, I am resting and recovering at the Lohrenz Shelter for Displaced Persons on Whidbey Island for a few weeks. All of the gear is clean, repaired, and stored.  All photos are edited and captioned for one to view on <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/reedmaniac\\/sets\\/72157634332346702\\/\\\">Flickr<\\/a>. And I had a job interview for a job in Bellingham this past Thursday.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tStill, I feel a bit adrift and am slightly frustrated that I really have nothing to do. After five months of hiking nearly every single day, it is difficult to simply stop and try to take it easy.  My body definitely needs the rest though. The bottoms of my feet have yet to stop aching and the knees are still requesting more time off as well. Patience is becoming the word of the day. Things will come in time: healing, job, exercise, money, direction.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tI am just ever so curious and ready to start.

When you first get off the trail, you still have a bit of a journey to get clean, fed, and back to some location, be it your own home or the home of friends and family. There are many hikers who continue exploring, this time in the cities, hoping to find the perfect place to settle.<\\/p><p>After you get back to civilization and settled, then what? Reading various thru-hiker blogs and from my own personal experience, there is a frustrating and listless adjustment period back in civilization. You just spent the last five months with relatively simple and direct goals. Find the next water source, make it to the next resupply, continue hiking.<\\/p><p>The frontcountry is not like that, at all. It is complicated, messy, noisy, indirect, and far less picturesque. Your activity level also just went from 10-12 hours a day to zero, so your endorphine levels tank.  Frankly, part of me feels like post-trail life is a directionless, monotonous, tedious mess and that I would be far better off surviving out there on the trail than back in civilization.<\\/p><p>Alas, that is not an option.  One must rejoin society, at least for a time, and address all of those niggling little issues like money, job, and the nebulous \\\"future plans\\\".<\\/p><p>My current plan is to work until I head back to school to finish my pre-medicine prerequisites. My intention was to take Organic Chemistry next summer, which would allow me to tackle Biochemistry, Physics, Genetics, and perhaps a bit of Physiology that next school year. Seems that most businesses or organizations do not really want to hear that you might only be with them for a year (or two if it is a really great job). That\'s frustrating. As if they have a guarantee from the rest of their employees that they will most assuredly be there for years to come. I am willing to commit fully to a really hard worked, challenging year of work.  Given my skills and experience, I can only hope some organization realizes that that is a good deal.<\\/p><p>In the meantime, I am trying to address all of the physical complications of the hike. Without a continuous source of moisture, my dog-esque foot pads have started cracking (lotion to the rescue!). The muscles have finally ceased to ache upon rising from a sitting position though and my heels are thinking about no longer being sore in the morning. Progress.<\\/p><p>A new pair of running shoes just arrived from Amazon yesterday and I unpacked my duffel to find my running\\/biking clothing. Thinking my first trail run may be tomorrow. The constant rain and wind on the island makes me think biking will have to wait until a weather window opens up; do not feel mentally ready for biking in shitty conditions near traffic.  I also need to stop eating so much junk food. Sure there are complex salads and healthy drinks back in my diet, but in less than 24 hours I have finished off a container of Trader Joe\'s Peanut Butter Cups. Boredom will do that to a former thru-hiker.<\\/p><p>The most important thing is patience and a sense of direction. Not everything will be resolved overnight or even over the next couple weeks. Taking a deep breath and learning to accept that is probably the best step to adjusting to being off trail.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2013-10-02 21:09:35', '2015-01-17 19:43:04', 'a3ff0bad-bb7f-40e0-885f-39a97ed48338'),

This is actually copied over from an even more detailed spreadsheet I created, so hopefully I got it all down correctly.  A little OCD?  Nah...\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/farm9.staticflickr.com\\/8265\\/8661124207_4d3f406d3f_z.jpg\\\">\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tMy base pack weight, which is considered what is in your pack <strong>not<\\/strong> including consumables like food, water, and fuel, is right at 15 pounds. I also included links to the product\'s website, Amazon, and REI to help readers get a range of information and reviews.  That being said, I shopped around and found quite a number of discounts from the likes of <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.geartrade.com\\\">GearTrade<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/backcountry.com\\\">Backcountry.com<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/ebay.com\\\">eBay<\\/a>, and <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.sierratradingpost.com\\\">Sierra Trading Post<\\/a>.  Thus, the prices listed at those sites will likely not match my \\\"purchased cost\\\" for each item.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tDespite having quite a plethora of gear already, unfortunately most of it is meant for activities like mountaineering and snow camping.  Not exactly lightweight.  So, I bit the bullet and bought new, ultralight versions of a shelter, sleeping bag\\/pad, and pack for a rather hefty cost of $995.  Yet, by buying those four items instead of using what I already owned, I reduced my base pack weight by over five pounds.  Considering the time and distance, I felt that was a worthwhile investment. After the big four, my next four largest purchases were a JetBoil Sol Titanium stove, a solar charger, and my hiking shirt and pants.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tJetBoil Sol Titanium.  While it seems the hip\\/cool ultralight PCT backpacker uses an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/jwbasecamp.com\\/Articles\\/SuperCat\\/\\\">alcohol stove<\\/a>, I simply could not get excited about using one. I know that when I cook while backpacking, I am usually about one evolutionary leap away from caveman and want my food <em><strong>now<\\/strong><\\/em>. Also did not like having to concern myself with alcohol measuring, the lack of simmering, and instability.  This new JetBoil boils 2 cups of water in about a minute, which is the perfect amount of water for most of my dinners, while a fuel cannister should last around two weeks.  Doubt I will regret this decision.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tSolar Charger. We are in the age of technology. Our smartphones are camera, GPS, web browser, app platform, and phone all in one.  The sCharger-5 Solar Charger is hopefully going to help me keep my iPhone powered. It was highly recommended by a few PCT hikers last year and my initial tests have shown it to be quite the little power delivery device when there is full sun.<br>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tHiking Shirt and Bottom.  I am not sure where I initially heard about <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.railriders.com\\\">RailRiders<\\/a>, but the more I read the more it looked like their clothes would be ideal for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  Lightweight, ventilated, quick drying, and long lasting.  One of my more blind faith gear choices, but sometimes you need to rely on a good feeling and hope it turns out to be right.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tEverything else is reasonably standard or self explanatory.  I am sure with more money<em>,<\\/em> research<em>, and<\\/em> sacrificing of comfort, I could reduce my base weight another 3 pounds and perhaps even have found cheaper items.  But, for now I am reasonably content with my choices.  We shall see how foolish I truly am once on the trail.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<table cellspacing=\\\"0\\\" cellpadding=\\\"0\\\" border=\\\"0\\\">\\r\\n<caption>Pack

To the point that there were situations where I really should have put up my tent but I did not want to trouble myself. Not a good sign, so I ordered the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL 1 at the Big Bear Lake Hostel and had it delivered to The Saufleys in Agua Dulce.<\\/p><p>Chose the Copper Spur for a few reasons.  It is a free standing tent, has a side vestibule (compared to the front vestibule on the Fly Creek), and is longer than the Fly Creek (I am 6\'1\\\").  The weight was around half a pound heavier than the Contrail, but I got a tent that would not collapse under wind or snow, had slightly more head room, and if it was a gorgeous night and I just wanted bug protection I could still see the moon, stars, and the occasional meteor shower.  Was pleased with my choice.<\\/p><p>Pros: Sturdy, free-standing, easy to stake, simple setup, great for buggy environments, dries super-quick, and tough.<\\/p><p>Cons: Bit heavier than most UL options, comfortable but not roomy for a large guy, rather pricey if you do not have a famous REI 20% coupon.<\\/p><p>Bottom Line: I was happy with my choice.

This first one will be about the big three of backpacking: the pack, the sleeping bag, and the tent. All totaled, these three items were 4.9 pounds of my base weight and cost $975.00.  Definitely earning the name Big Three as that is a third of my base weight and about half of my gear cost.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Big-Agnes-Copper-Ultralight-Backpacking\\/dp\\/B00224Z7QE\\/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\\\">Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1<\\/a><\\/strong><strong><br>\\r\\n\\t<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/farm4.staticflickr.com\\/3670\\/9445246014_3584051456_z.jpg\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tI originally started out with a Tarptent Contrail, which Amelia greatly loved, but I found myself becoming more and more annoyed during the first couple weeks thanks to the wind storms and poor staking conditions; to the point that there were situations where I really should have put up my tent but I did not want to trouble myself. Not a good sign, so I ordered the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL 1 at the Big Bear Lake hostel and had it delivered to The Saufleys in Agua Dulce.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tChose the Copper Spur for a few reasons.  It is a free standing tent, has a side vestibule (compared to the front vestibule on the Fly Creek), and is longer than the Fly Creek (I am 6\'1\\\").  The weight was around half a pound heavier than the Contrail, but I got a tent that would not collapse under wind or snow, had slightly more head room, and if it was a gorgeous night and I just wanted bug protection I could still see the moon, stars, and the occasional meteor shower.  Was pleased with my choice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Sturdy, free-standing, easy to stake, simple setup, great for buggy environments, dries super-quick, and tough.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons:<\\/strong> Bit heavier than most UL options, comfortable but not roomy for a large guy, rather pricey if you do not have a famous REI 20% coupon.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended. I was happy with my choice.  Might be tempted to try another ultralight option in the future though (ex: <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.zpacks.com\\/shelter\\/hexamid_plus.shtml\\\">Hexamid<\\/a>), if I had spare cash, as the weight did bug me a bit.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.zpacks.com\\/quilts\\/sleepingbag.shtml\\\">ZPacks 20 Degree Down Sleeping Bag<\\/a> (Wide, X-Long)<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/farm3.staticflickr.com\\/2827\\/9951925205_e3004b558f_z.jpg\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tLike many thru-hikers, I did my research and was intending to use a \\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.backcountry.com\\/western-mountaineering-ultralite-sleeping-bag-20-degree-down-wes0031\\\">Western Mountaineering Ultralite down sleeping bag<\\/a>. Right towards the end of the trip planning phase, while reading Yet Another Hiking Blog (YAHB), I discovered ZPacks.  The Western Mountaineering Ultralite long was 31 oz, while the ZPacks Wide, X-Long was only 21.7 oz.  And it was cheaper.  The ZPacks bag is basically what happens when a down quilt and a down sleeping bag have a baby, with a couple genetic enhancements.  It was fantastic.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe only real downside really had to do with the trail itself. Quite often a 20 degree bag was overkill in the desert.  And yet, three days later that bag could be indispensable when a freezing cold night happened. Washington rained on us almost a third of the times, so  I protected my sleeping bag by putting it inside a trash bag inside a cuben sack inside the trash compactor bag lined part of my pack.  Even with that, a handful of times it got a bit damp while unstuffed in my tent.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Warm, lightweight, compressible, did not cover my head (I suffer from anti-mummy tendencies and prefer a hat), worked great as a blanket.  When it was really cold, it was AMAZING!<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons: <\\/strong>Expensive. Bit too warm for about half of California. Constant vigilance required in Washington to keep it dry.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended.  If I had to do it again, I might consider using a lower degree bag and then carrying a liner for the Sierras and Washington.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/gossamergear.com\\/packs\\/backpacks\\/mariposa-ultralight-backpack-all.html\\\">Gossamer Gear Mariposa<\\/a><\\/strong><sub><br>\\r\\n\\t<\\/sub><\\/p><p><img src=\\\"{asset:117:url}\\\"><\\/p><p>Sadly, I do not have a good shot of myself using this backpack in the wild. Typically I was carrying it on my back, so I suppose that is not completely unexpected. Stock photo to the rescue!<\\/p><p>Probably one of the pieces of ultralight gear I was most skeptical about.  Currently, I have four other backpacks that I use for all variety of purposes: guiding, mountaineering, quick summit hops from basecamp, et cetera.  For me a pack needs to hold the right amount of gear comfortably for days while making my gear easily accessible.  Surely a pack that ways less than 2 pounds could not handle all of the trials of a thru-hike.  <em>I was wrong.<\\/em>  Except for when it was overloaded with a bear canister and\\/or 6-7 days worth of food, it worked perfectly.  It was meant to carry 35 pounds or less, and I think that is spot on.  Go over that and your pack (and you) will suffer for it.  The aluminum stays and padding is just not capable of handling more than that amount of weight or strain.  You have been warned.<\\/p><p>By the way, its removable pad for sitting is a great idea.  I used it constantly during breaks and meals. So much in fact that I eventually had to replace it in Echo Lake.  Hat tip to Gossamer Gear for that idea.<\\/p><p><strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Lightweight, cheap, durable (2668+ miles and still usable), perfect volume for a thru-hiker.<\\/p><p><strong>Cons:<\\/strong> Both grommets came out and had to be repaired with floss and needle.  Not ideal for heavy loads in the Sierras. I am hard on my gear so I tried to be a bit more gentle with this pack to insure it survived the journey.<\\/p><p><strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended.

While most thru-hikers were still figuring out where to safely put their alcohol stoves, my water was already boiled.  It is actually so fast that I spent more time boiling the water than finding the food I wanted to eat in my food bag.  So, if all you are doing is rehydrating meals of potatoes, oatmeal, instant rice, et cetera and you are not fond of the wait or issues with alcohol, then this is the stove for you.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tHowever, you cannot cook with it.  Well, that is not entirely true, you can cook with it, but it is a pain in the ass. I used the ol\' trusted method of cooking food inside of a freezer bag placed inside of the boiling water of the cup to cook a few things.  Did not find it particularly enjoyable or easy.  During the first week I tried, foolishly, to cook some noodles in the JetBoil, completely against the recommendations of the manufacturer.  There are still burnt marks on the bottom of the pot.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe stove also sips fuel.  One of the small 100g canisters typically lasted me 3 weeks when having one or two meals a day.  A fellow hiker gave me a full canister of one of the larger sizes (230g, I think).  It lasted me all the way from Echo Lake, CA to Timberline Lodge, OR.  A distance of over a thousand miles.  That is damn impressive.  If you do choose a JetBoil, leave the stand at home.  I never used it.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe Grease Pot was a great vessel for my meals.  Lightweight and very resilient to the beatings of a thru-hike.  And during the day, I put all of my snacks inside it on the outside of my pack.  Worked out great.  As for the Titanium Spork: it survived the entire trip completely intact.  I think the \\\"fork\\\" aspect is unnecessary though.  I used it more for opening packages than I ever did for spearing my food.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros: <\\/strong>Fast boiling, sips fuel, lightweight, and the envy of morning coffee drinkers with an alcohol stove.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons:<\\/strong> Bit heavier than an alcohol stove.

Even during testing at home I became impatient with the amount of time it took to squeeze a couple litres into my Platypus Platy Bottles, especially since the bottles were flexible and did not stand up well when empty.  Thru-hikers simply want their gear to work quickly and well, but once you leak water onto your pants for the tenth time, forget to bring the filter into to the tent on a freezing cold night, or have issues back flushing...the Sawyer filter has failed that test.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSo, my backup water treatment was too wee bottles of Aquamira.  Once I started using those I never looked back and bought more on Amazon and shipped them to myself when necessary. Towards the end even Amelia was using it.  Many people complain online about the 5 minutes required for the two chemicals to react before being put into the water.  Honestly, if you think about how long it takes to fill up the bottles, go pee, and grab a snack you are essentially at 5 minutes.  I had two 1-litre bottles that I cycled through for drinking that were in one of my side pockets, so I added the Aquamira and kept on walking.  15 minutes later, I could drink the water.  Pretty darn easy.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThere are other <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Portable_water_purification\\\">ways to treat water<\\/a> in the wilderness such as <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/iaspub.epa.gov\\/tdb\\/pages\\/treatment\\/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=-1118142891\\\">bleach<\\/a>, but <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/iaspub.epa.gov\\/tdb\\/pages\\/treatment\\/treatmentOverview.do?treatmentProcessId=-1277754943\\\">chlorine dioxide<\\/a> (aka Aquamira) is more effective against Cryptosporidium and Giardia while also improving the taste of the water and not creating any harmful byproducts.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Quick, easy, reliable, better than bleach or filters, reasonably cheap<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons:<\\/strong> None unless you are really impatient.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Water Containers - Bottled water bottles, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/gp\\/product\\/B000J2KEGY\\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\\\">Platypus Platy Bottles<\\/a><\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tWhen you have to carry more than 2 litres, say in most of California except for the Sierras, the Platy bottles are fantastic.

A fellow hiker gave me a full canister of one of the larger sizes (230g, I think).  It lasted me all the way from Echo Lake, CA to Timberline Lodge, OR.  A distance of over a thousand miles.  That is damn impressive.  If you do choose a JetBoil, leave the stand at home.  I never used it.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe Grease Pot was a great vessel for my meals.  Lightweight and very resilient to the beatings of a thru-hike.  And during the day, I put all of my snacks inside it on the outside of my pack.  Worked out great.  As for the Titanium Spork: it survived the entire trip completely intact.  I think the \\\"fork\\\" aspect is unnecessary though.  I used it more for opening packages than I ever did for spearing my food.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros: <\\/strong>Fast boiling, sips fuel, lightweight, and the envy of morning coffee drinkers with an alcohol stove.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons:<\\/strong> Bit heavier than an alcohol stove.

Even during testing at home I became impatient with the amount of time it took to squeeze a couple litres into my Platypus Platy Bottles, especially since the bottles were flexible and did not stand up well when empty.  Thru-hikers simply want their gear to work quickly and well, but once you leak water onto your pants for the tenth time, forget to bring the filter into to the tent on a freezing cold night, or have issues back flushing...the Sawyer filter has failed that test.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSo, my backup water treatment was too wee bottles of Aquamira.  Once I started using those I never looked back and bought more on Amazon and shipped them to myself when necessary. Towards the end even Amelia was using it.  Many people complain online about the 5 minutes required for the two chemicals to react before being put into the water.  Honestly, if you think about how long it takes to fill up the bottles, go pee, and grab a snack you are essentially at 5 minutes.  I had two 1-litre bottles that I cycled through for drinking that were in one of my side pockets, so I added the Aquamira and kept on walking.  15 minutes later, I could drink the water.

While most thru-hikers were still figuring out where to safely put their alcohol stoves, my water was already boiled.  It is actually so fast that I spent more time boiling the water than finding the food I wanted to eat in my food bag.  So, if all you are doing is rehydrating meals of potatoes, oatmeal, instant rice, et cetera and you are not fond of the wait or issues with alcohol, then this is the stove for you.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tHowever, you cannot cook with it.  Well, that is not entirely true, you can cook with it, but it is a pain in the ass. I used the ol\' trusted method of cooking food inside of a freezer bag placed inside of the boiling water of the cup to cook a few things.  Did not find it particularly enjoyable or easy.  During the first week I tried, foolishly, to cook some noodles in the JetBoil, completely against the recommendations of the manufacturer.  There are still burnt marks on the bottom of the pot.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe stove also sips fuel.  One of the small 100g canisters typically lasted me 3 weeks when having one or two meals a day.  A fellow hiker gave me a full canister of one of the larger sizes (230g, I think).  It lasted me all the way from Echo Lake, CA to Timberline Lodge, OR.  A distance of over a thousand miles.  That is damn impressive.  If you do choose a JetBoil, leave the stand at home.  I never used it.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe Grease Pot was a great vessel for my meals.  Lightweight and very resilient to the beatings of a thru-hike.  And during the day, I put all of my snacks inside it on the outside of my pack.  Worked out great.

I very foolishly put a bag with a sharp object underneath it in the Sierras while elevating my feet. Went right through both sides.

While most thru-hikers were still figuring out where to safely put their alcohol stoves, my water was already boiled.  It is actually so fast that I spent less time boiling the water than finding the food I wanted to eat in my food bag.  So, if all you are doing is rehydrating meals of potatoes, oatmeal, instant rice, noodles, et cetera and you are not fond of the wait or issues with alcohol, then this is the stove for you.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tHowever, you cannot cook with it.  Well, that is not entirely true, you can cook with it, but it is a pain in the ass. I used the ol\' trusted method of cooking food inside of a freezer bag placed inside the boiling water to cook a few meals.  Did not find it particularly enjoyable or easy.  During the first week I tried, foolishly, to cook some noodles in the JetBoil, completely against the recommendations of the manufacturer.  There are still burnt marks on the bottom of the pot.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe stove also sips fuel.  One of the small 100g canisters typically lasted me 3 weeks when having one or two meals a day.  A fellow hiker gave me a full canister of one of the larger sizes (230g, I think).  It lasted me all the way from Echo Lake, CA to Timberline Lodge, OR.  A distance of over a thousand miles.  That is damn impressive.  If you do choose a JetBoil, leave the stand at home.  I never used it.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe Grease Pot was a great vessel for my meals.  Lightweight and very resilient to the beatings of a thru-hike.  And during the day I put all of my snacks inside it on the outside of my pack.  Worked out great.  As for the Titanium Spork: it survived the entire trip completely intact.  I think the \\\"fork\\\" aspect is unnecessary though.  I used it more for opening packages than I ever did for spearing my food.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros: <\\/strong>Fast boiling, sips fuel, lightweight, and the envy of morning coffee drinkers with an alcohol stove.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons:<\\/strong> Bit heavier than an alcohol stove. No simmering.  Fork aspect of spork was not necessary.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended.  Would probably choose a titanium spoon over the spork and insure it is of a size that it would fit in the pot.<\\/p><h4>\\r\\nWater Treatment - <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/gp\\/product\\/B000OR111G\\/ref=as_li_ss_tl?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\\\">Aqua Mira<\\/a><\\/h4><p>\\r\\n\\tIn retrospect, starting with the Sawyer Squeeze Filter was a nice experiment but it should have never gone on the trip. Even during testing at home I became impatient with the amount of time it took to squeeze a couple litres into my Platypus Platy Bottles, especially since the bottles were flexible and did not stand up well when empty.  Thru-hikers simply want their gear to work quickly and well, but once you leak water onto your pants for the tenth time, forget to bring the filter into to the tent on a freezing cold night, or have issues back flushing...the Sawyer filter has failed that test.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSo, my backup water treatment was two wee bottles of Aquamira.  Once I started using those I never looked back and bought more on Amazon and shipped them to myself as necessary. Towards the end even Amelia was using it.  Many people complain online about the 5 minutes required for the two chemicals to react before being put into the water.  Honestly, if you think about how long it takes to fill up the bottles, go pee, and grab a snack you are essentially at 5 minutes.

This thin margin of safety would often extend to their food and water.  A number of thru-hikers would be out of food the night before their next resupply or would show up at water sources having been empty for miles. While the PCT is reasonably well traveled and usually less than a day away from civilization, there are 5-7 day sections without a single road and no reliable cell service. Further, even if someone does show up within a short amount of time (not always the best assumption itself), it does not mean they will have the materials or skills to help you out.

Shortly after I finished the PCT this year, a series of snowstorms hit the Cascades.

Multiple people had to be rescued, a few by helicopter because Search & Rescue could not safely reach them by foot.

The noise of civilization comes to mind first.  I have taken longish backcountry trips before and when I returned to Portland, the cars whizzing by on 39th Avenue had me on edge for over a week before I acclimated to city life again.  Now after being on the PCT for over a month, being in something as simple as a remote town with a small grocery store with all of the music, talking, and the noise that humans create is slightly unsettling.<\\/p><p>Showers and beds are odd now too. I am staying with the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/boyinks4adventure.com\\/\\\">Boyink <\\/a>family this weekend and even though I could easily sleep in their RV, I feel far more comfortable sleeping outside, under the stars, with a bit of wind.  And, I feel no compulsion to take a shower every day or even every other day.  I am hardly getting dirty sitting around eating, talking, and reading books.  Why would I need to shower?  Showers are now meant for when you need to wash off the grime after days on the trail and be presentable.<\\/p><p>I definitely daydream about reading material and food on the trail.  The ability to eat the wide assortment of foods in an American grocery store is truly a wonder when you think about it.  Ice cream, cinnamon rolls, pumpkin pie, stir fry, salads, et cetera.  All sound really good when I get into town.  And, I have now finished seven books on this trip. Every town stop has me tossing one book into the Hiker Box and looking for a new one (or two) for the next section.<\\/p><p>The cool weather of the Pacific Northwest combined with my old, glorious apartment has been on my mind during the bad days too.  While crossing the Mojave desert, I had at least a litre and a half of water throughout the night and still woke up dehydrated.  The hot, arid weather does not agree with me. Being able to watch a windy, wet storm go on outside while watching Doctor Who and eating pie often sounds like bliss.<\\/p><p>What I really miss most though, is friendly, relaxed company.  The trail is stressful. It is all too often empty and even a bit lonely.  There have been a handful of days when I see no one until the end of the day and at least a third of my nights have been spent camping alone.  Despite all of my introverted and asocial tendencies, I do crave human companionship on a semi-regular basis. Part of this trip\'s learning experience is being forced to examine how isolated I have made my non-trail daily life and how going further down that path is unenjoyable in the long term.<\\/p><p>The examination of how to balance my need to be alone, do challenging adventures, and my desire for human company is ongoing.  Many more months to think about it.<\\/p><p><strong>UPDATE: <\\/strong>OK, so let\'s get one thing straight. While I do not really miss showers on a daily basis, after five or six days of hiking I greatly enjoy washing the grime off both myself and my clothes.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2013-10-22 23:52:43', '2015-01-17 19:43:04', 'de377def-a2fa-4cd1-9373-1cff9a5cc00a'),

A damn damn dirty lie.  <\\/p><p>Bad days happen on the trail, there is no way around it.  And, it is incredible how just one slip in judgment or a seemingly minuscule event can cause an otherwise normal day to tailspin into a fantastically wretched day. I was extremely lucky in that my first four weeks on the trail I only had one bad day. Too much sun, an unsettled stomach, and a poor night\'s sleep sapped my energy so that I felt thrashed from the moment I woke up. The entire day consisted in nothing but forcing myself to take steps and wishing for it to be over.<\\/p><p>This last week had three bad days in quick succession.  It all started after Agua Dulce.  Epsom salt foot baths were available at Hiker Heaven and since my heel calluses seemed a bit overgrown, I indulged in one to soften them up a bit (such a horrible idea in retrospect).  Foolishly, I never washed my feet off afterward to clear off the salt.  The next day, after a poor night of sleep, I started off at 5 a.m. to beat the heat as the trail started with about five miles of road walking.  By the time I got back on a proper trail, my feet had lost a couple layers of skin in key places.  That was just the beginning.<\\/p><p>Even with clean socks, blister pads, and duct tape the hot spots got worse, especially on my heels.  There was little shade once the sun rose and my whole body slowly roasted until I stumbled into the fire station just up from the Anderson\'s (trail angels at Casa de Luna).  I was definitely not the only hiker who was suffering from foot problems  either, thanks to the heat baking both the ground and our bodies.  Five of the six hikers I met while resting at the fire station reported that their feet had become messed up over the course of the day.<\\/p><p>Still, after resting for three or four hours and cleaning all feet and socks, I continued on to the next water cache.  That was a bit of foolish of me.  I did not need to continue on and my feet could have used a longer recovery period.  But it was early still.  I wanted to stick with and camp with people I knew.  So, I kept on going.  ::sigh::<\\/p><p>By the time I camped my feet had graduated from possibly problematic to a complete mess.  I had also lost my brand new book (left behind during a break), cut my hand while getting off trail for a bathroom break, and was all around miserable from mile dehydration and miles of constant descent.  If a genie had appeared and offered to whisk me back to my old, lovely apartment in Port Townsend with a fresh episode of Doctor Who waiting...doubt I would have said no.<\\/p><p>To make a long story short, despite trying to baby my feet and not push too hard, I had a limited supply of food and a desert to cross until my next resupply.  The next few days of hiking were not pleasant at all, especially since I forgot my second pair of socks drying on a fence and my backup socks were given to a desperate friend a few days before. Feeling the searing hot pain of a blister popping? One of the most demoralizing experiences a hiker can feel.  Combine it with the usual trail trials and every additional minor problem just compounded my mental and physical fatigue.  Only will power kept me from just collapsing in a heap yesterday.<\\/p><p>All of which reinforces the fact that thru-hikers are a stubborn lot.  It takes a special combination of foolishness, insanity, and mental resiliency to willfully subject your body and mind to a thru-hike. Yet, hikers do have ways of responding to the stress and handling those really bad days.  <\\/p><p>I have seen an older gentleman on a rather steep bit of remote trail with hardly a rock to sit on calling his wife just to hear a kind voice during a particularly difficult stretch.  A hiker couple just barely leaning into each other during a snack break to feel that small bit of support.  Hiker camaraderie and bitching sessions are quite common at the end of the day and during long breaks.  Vacant stares into the distance and crying happen too.  During the Mojave desert crossing at one point three of just dead dropped our packs, flopped on the ground, and did not say anything for two or three minutes while we ate food and collected ourselves.<\\/p><p>My primary way of dealing with the grind is sharing my experiences and photos on Twitter and Facebook almost daily.  The desert is photogenic and heart-stopping beautiful at times, despite the heat.  And a Don Quixote reference while crossing a wind turbine farm in the early morning has most definitely not gone unused.  That bit of humor and sharing with friends around the world is what kept me going during those bad days.  And remembering the fact that I genuinely enjoy sharing the outdoors with other people is not a bad thought either.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2013-10-22 23:55:12', '2015-01-17 19:43:04', '0a15fd0b-1b75-446b-a770-9b5ce44a9790'),

Simply is not a big enough screen with the keyboard to make writing enjoyable. One of those times when I wonder how an iPad Mini would hold up.  For the most part, I am writing these blog posts whenever I get to a town that has a library. Alas, library internet is not overly fast and all the computers are using an old version of Internet Explorer by default.  So, I have been downloading Chrome to make the whole writing situation more palatable.  That takes a while with the connection speed and then in no time my time is up.  Thus, these entries are written quickly and with very little proof reading.  Anyhoo...here are a few updates regarding the gear I have been using.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Tarptent Contrail.<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tWith such a lightweight and seemingly easy setup, I really thought I would love this tent for my first attempts at both doing a thru-hike and going ultralight.  Alas, no.  The desert regions have had rather strong winds and at times difficult ground (too hard, too sandy). Since the tent is not freestanding, it has been extremely difficult making it robust enough to survive a night of high winds.  At Whitewater Creek, when the front containing a thunderstorm started coming in, my tent collapsed twice, despite staking it AND using a copious amount of rocks to reinforce the stakes.  When you stop wanting to set up your tent at all and just cowboy camp every night, that is a problem. So, I threw in the towel and have ordered a new tent, Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1, from REI.  It is a bit heavier, but it is freestanding and has been praised by other hikers on the trail.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Brooks Cascadia 8 Shoes.<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tLove these shoes.  When I was testing shoes prior to the hiker, I always seemed to get sore feet after 8 or 10 miles. Not with these.  I have done a 28 mile day in the desert heat and my feet were not sore afterwards. They may not be able to survive as much punishment as more dedicated hiking shoes though.  Around mile 340, I noticed that the tread was loose and there were tiny holes where the end of my pinky toe ends.  Thankfully, at Cajon Junction, a fellow hiker, Dingo, rented a car and we took a trip to REI (two hour trip because of a brush fire that closed the interstate and caused a massive traffic snarl).\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tREI, to their credit, replaced the shoes but with a stern look and voice informing me that these shoes were not meant for this manner of activity.  We shall see if this pair survives the next 300-500 miles or if the PCT abuses it too much.  Even if I have to replace them every 350 miles, I think I will stick with them, they are simply too light and comfortable.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Gossamer Gear Mariposa Backpack<\\/strong>.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tSolid.  Light, perfect size, and so far standing up to the abuse.  I have put one hole into its big mesh pocket, but that was a sharp trekking pole.  One of the hip pouch zippers seems to be coming loose, but I think I can fix that up without any problem.  The removal sit pad is genius.  I had my doubts, but I use it multiple times a day.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>ZPacks 900 Fill Power Down, 20 degree Sleeping Bag.<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThis one is tough. While up at Coon Creek Cabin, at over 8000 feet, the temperature dropped to at least 15 degrees Fahrenheit. I was perfectly cozy in this bag with my long underwear on and a hat.  However, on those nights when the desert only cools to a balmy 58 degrees Fahrenheit, this bag is much much too warm.  After hiking 20+ miles and eating a solid dinner, my legs seem to radiate ungodly amounts of heat.  I have taken to putting on my sleeping clothes and using the sleeping bag as a blanket only for my top.  This is not really the fault of the bag, but I do miss having a full length zipper so I can better free my legs to the night air while keeping my torso comfortable.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Sawyer Squeeze Water Filter.<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThis filter works well.  It works really well. Having seen how much people love the inline Sawyer filter for their CamelBaks is having me contemplating a switch.  It only takes probably 5-7 minutes to make all the water I will need for a long stretch, but it is not as convenient as simply being able to empty the water into your hydration bladder and go.  No worries, virtually no effort.  Hard to not desire that a bit.  The REI we went to from Cajon Junction did not have the inline adapter in stock, but if I see it later on I might impulse buy it.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>KEEN Socks.<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tMore details about this will come a bit later.  The Smartwool socks I started with did not survive much past two weeks; holes in the heels. The KEEN socks arrived 10 days in and 16 days in.  They seem to be surviving, but thinning a bit in the heels and balls of my feet.  We shall see how they survive the next two weeks.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Everything Else.<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThose are the major items.  Will have more likely later, but otherwise by gear is living up perfectly to my expectations.  Two things I seem to be constantly low on is duct tape and blister bandaids.  Even with airing out of my feet a few times a day and changing into dry (and maybe recently rinsed) socks, I seem to develop a hot spot or blister every few days.  My feet are slowly recovering\\/thickening but the desert is a harsh mistress.\\r\\n<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2013-10-23 00:00:04', '2015-01-17 19:43:04', '9a8dfc65-233e-4a88-8d6f-ee529f743a77'),

Having known each other for about nine years through many trials and tribulations, we have settled into a Calvin\\/Hobbesian friendship as near to family as one can be without blood.  We also both suffer from a certain kind of madness and take a special glee in it, and thus are both the kind of people to go backpacking for 5 months.  While we will be starting at the same time down in Campo, California and her parents are our resupply coordinators, our 10 inch difference in height and rather different personalities means we will be hiking in tandem rather than together on the PCT.

Adams and while jumping down from a ledge my right patella\\/kneecap slammed into a small rock outcropping.  Took out a sizable chunk of skin and made the next two days of traveling rather painful.  Back in town, I got an X-ray just to confirm there was nothing broken and got fitted with a leg brace to wear for 10 days.  It improved but was still a bit painful.  A month later, I reinjured it, which lead to me seeing an orthopedic surgeon and dropping out of the pre-medicine program I was enrolled in.  Physical therapy went well but two and a half months in, it took a severe turn for the worse.  No idea why, but it is possible the cartilage was still loosely attached somewhere and finally tore completely.  That led to arthroscopic surgery that discovered a severe defect in my articular cartilage and cracks throughout.  They cleaned up what they could, but it was not the result they were hoping for.  What followed was six months of slow, difficult physical therapy just to get back to walking in a straight line and pedaling up hills on my bike.<\\/p><p>Basically a mess with torn ligament\\/tendon, impinged fat pad, and the damaged cartilage.  And so, after eight years of soccer, decades of trail running, and a lifetime spent outdoors I got a bum knee all because I jumped and my knee was half an inch from being in the clear.  But, I have kept on exercising and pushing it so that I have done hour long trail runs, snowshoed into a remote fire tower, and been training with a 30 pound backpack on 10-12 mile hikes.  The knee will never be 100% again and it might not handle the PCT mileage, but I have prepared it as best I can.<\\/p><p><strong>Are you excited?!?!<\\/strong><br><\\/p><p>Not so much excited as I am curious. Very very curious. Curious to know if my knee will hold up. Curious to know how my gear will work. Curious to know who I will meet on the trail. Curious to see how the trail changes me. It\'s an adventure. Exploring, hiking, trying new things, seeing new locations, meeting new people.  Makes me very curious to see how it all turns out.<br><\\/p><p><strong>What will you do when you are done?<\\/strong><\\/p><p>This question amuses me.  I just spent four months planning a five month backpacking trip, which I have not even started, and you already want to know what I will do next?  At this point, I am waiting to see how the first month of this trip goes. Only after that will I really get a sense how the rest of my year will shape up.  I do have ideas though!

This first one will be about the big three of backpacking: the pack, the sleeping bag, and the tent. All totaled, these three items were 4.9 pounds of my base weight and cost $975.00.  Definitely earning the name Big Three as that is a third of my base weight and about half of my gear cost.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Big-Agnes-Copper-Ultralight-Backpacking\\/dp\\/B00224Z7QE\\/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\\\">Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1<\\/a><\\/strong><strong><br>\\r\\n\\t<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/farm4.staticflickr.com\\/3670\\/9445246014_3584051456_z.jpg\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tI originally started out with a Tarptent Contrail, which Amelia greatly loved, but I found myself becoming more and more annoyed during the first couple weeks thanks to the wind storms and poor staking conditions; to the point that there were situations where I really should have put up my tent but I did not want to trouble myself. Not a good sign, so I ordered the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL 1 at the Big Bear Lake hostel and had it delivered to The Saufleys in Agua Dulce.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tChose the Copper Spur for a few reasons.  It is a free standing tent, has a side vestibule (compared to the front vestibule on the Fly Creek), and is longer than the Fly Creek (I am 6\'1\\\").  The weight was around half a pound heavier than the Contrail, but I got a tent that would not collapse under wind or snow, had slightly more head room, and if it was a gorgeous night and I just wanted bug protection I could still see the moon, stars, and the occasional meteor shower.  Was pleased with my choice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Sturdy, free-standing, easy to stake, simple setup, great for buggy environments, dries super-quick, and tough.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons:<\\/strong> Bit heavier than most UL options, comfortable but not roomy for a large guy, rather pricey if you do not have a famous REI 20% coupon.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended. I was happy with my choice.  Might be tempted to try another ultralight option in the future though (ex: <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.zpacks.com\\/shelter\\/hexamid_plus.shtml\\\">Hexamid<\\/a>), if I had spare cash, as the weight did bug me a bit.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.zpacks.com\\/quilts\\/sleepingbag.shtml\\\">ZPacks 20 Degree Down Sleeping Bag<\\/a> (Wide, X-Long)<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/farm3.staticflickr.com\\/2827\\/9951925205_e3004b558f_z.jpg\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tLike many thru-hikers, I did my research and was intending to use a \\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.backcountry.com\\/western-mountaineering-ultralite-sleeping-bag-20-degree-down-wes0031\\\">Western Mountaineering Ultralite down sleeping bag<\\/a>. Right towards the end of the trip planning phase, while reading Yet Another Hiking Blog (YAHB), I discovered ZPacks.  The Western Mountaineering Ultralite long was 31 oz, while the ZPacks Wide, X-Long was only 21.7 oz.  And it was cheaper.  The ZPacks bag is basically what happens when a down quilt and a down sleeping bag have a baby, with a couple genetic enhancements.  It was fantastic.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe only real downside really had to do with the trail itself. Quite often a 20 degree bag was overkill in the desert.  And yet, three days later that bag could be indispensable when a freezing cold night happened. Washington rained on us almost a third of the times, so  I protected my sleeping bag by putting it inside a trash bag inside a cuben sack inside the trash compactor bag lined part of my pack.  Even with that, a handful of times it got a bit damp while unstuffed in my tent.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Warm, lightweight, compressible, did not cover my head (I suffer from anti-mummy tendencies and prefer a hat), worked great as a blanket.  When it was really cold, it was AMAZING!<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons: <\\/strong>Expensive. Bit too warm for about half of California. Constant vigilance required in Washington to keep it dry.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended.  If I had to do it again, I might consider using a higher degree bag and then carrying a liner for the Sierras and Washington.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/gossamergear.com\\/packs\\/backpacks\\/mariposa-ultralight-backpack-all.html\\\">Gossamer Gear Mariposa<\\/a><\\/strong><sub><br>\\r\\n\\t<\\/sub><\\/p><p><img src=\\\"{asset:117:url}\\\"><\\/p><p>Sadly, I do not have a good shot of myself using this backpack in the wild. Typically I was carrying it on my back, so I suppose that is not completely unexpected. Stock photo to the rescue!<\\/p><p>Probably one of the pieces of ultralight gear I was most skeptical about.  Currently, I have four other backpacks that I use for all variety of purposes: guiding, mountaineering, quick summit hops from basecamp, et cetera.  For me a pack needs to hold the right amount of gear comfortably for days while making my gear easily accessible.  Surely a pack that ways less than 2 pounds could not handle all of the trials of a thru-hike.  <em>I was wrong.<\\/em>  Except for when it was overloaded with a bear canister and\\/or 6-7 days worth of food, it worked perfectly.  It was meant to carry 35 pounds or less, and I think that is spot on.  Go over that and your pack (and you) will suffer for it.  The aluminum stays and padding is just not capable of handling more than that amount of weight or strain.  You have been warned.<\\/p><p>By the way, its removable pad for sitting is a great idea.  I used it constantly during breaks and meals. So much in fact that I eventually had to replace it in Echo Lake.  Hat tip to Gossamer Gear for that idea.<\\/p><p><strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Lightweight, cheap, durable (2668+ miles and still usable), perfect volume for a thru-hiker.<\\/p><p><strong>Cons:<\\/strong> Both grommets came out and had to be repaired with floss and needle.  Not ideal for heavy loads in the Sierras. I am hard on my gear so I tried to be a bit more gentle with this pack to insure it survived the journey.<\\/p><p><strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended. They informed me via email that they know about the grommet issue and are addressing it.  For the Sierras, I think I would have mailed myself one of my heavier and more sturdier packs (Osprey Atmos?) to make the large loads more comfortable.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2014-01-07 06:02:55', '2015-01-17 19:43:04', '5dc74178-c87c-4175-90db-9d92dd773d43');

I am not sure how to politely phrase it to them how incredibly annoyed that makes me.  Every single day I am made acutely aware that I have scar tissue in my tendon and a spot of missing patellar articular cartilage. I habitually massage my knee whenever I sit down; almost as if subconsciously I believe I can rub the damage away.  My knee is never going to be \\\"good\\\" again.<\\/p><p>In all probability, gone are the days when I could run a half marathon before breakfast. Those intense trail running days where I would fly through the woods of Forest Park are likely behind me. Not only would attempting to run them be unpleasant but my orthopedic surgeon believes it would cause more damage in the long term. Alas, the medical technology does not exist yet where we can reliably regrow my cartilage and smooth the scar tissue.<\\/p><p>Obviously, I can still be extremely active with it. Thanks to another month of physical therapy post-trail and constant work, I can reliably do three hour bike rides, swim two miles in the pool, and row nearly an hour on the erg without pain. Further, just last evening I was at the gym and after an hour of biking and rowing, I finally pulled off 200 lunges. If I am patient and slowly increase the length and difficulty of my exercises, I can strength my knees to a level where I can safely do mountaineering and full day bike rides, perhaps even on consecutive days.  Patience and commitment are key though.<\\/p><p>I love being active. Prior to my knee injury, I took a special joy in not giving a damn about races or training programs, yet still smoking serious athletes during runs or rides. Whenever people get too serious about stroking their egos, I get bored.  Who really cares about PRs? Did you have fun? Was there joy in what you did? Pushing yourself to the point of exhaustion and still grinning is one of the best feelings. Staring at a watch is boring.<\\/p><p>Of course, I will never win a race. I lack the discipline and the requisite hardcore athlete psychological quirk that drives people to track their protein intake and heart rate. The idea of flying to another state to run 26.2 miles on pavement? My mind is completely incapable of comprehending how that could ever be fun or worthwhile.<\\/p><p>My training is meant for one thing and one thing only, to allow myself to do more. I constantly daydream about biking 200 miles in one day (Hood River to The Dalles to Mt. Bachelor), doing another thru-hike, and organizing a weekend adventure race of my own devising with swimming, biking, climbing, and kayaking.<\\/p><p>If you ever want to do amazing things with your body and push it to point of making things seem effortless, that is how you need to train, not for numbers or ego but for fun and joy.

Still, I think the time has come to at least start pulling back a bit of the curtain.<\\/p><p>We are a little over a month away from inviting Portland individuals, companies, and non-profits to help us beta test, and a splash page is already visible at&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/signup.impactflow.com\\\">ImpactFlow.com<\\/a>. Just last week I finished setting up a complete staging environment on the amazing&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/forge.laravel.com\\/\\\">Laravel Forge<\\/a> and we are prepping to start our internal testing at the end of next week. The pressure is beginning to build; it is quite exciting (if a bit stressful). So, what is this mysterious ImpactFlow?<\\/p><blockquote>ImpactFlow is a marketplace for philanthropy, where individuals and businesses manage their giving like investments to support the causes they care most about. <p>Nonprofits showcase their projects and get matched to funds from donors they know are interested in the work they are doing.<\\/p><\\/blockquote><p>Philanthropy is a Big Word&trade; that has quite a bit of weight behind it. At its core, it is a catchall term meaning one is trying to make the world better though some manner of giving, be it money, property, or personal time.&nbsp;Like any product, we are trying to solve a problem.&nbsp;If you are truly serious about having an impact with your giving, it is a messy and inefficient process. Each non-profit has its own website and their specific projects may or may not be on it. How their projects impact the community or world at large may not be readily apparent. Directly investing in specific projects that catch your eye is seldom possible. &nbsp;An individual or company can literally spend months searching for the perfect place to give their money, yet still end up just writing a check to the non-profit as a general donation and only receive monthly emails as a result.<\\/p><p>On the flip side, non-profits are always searching for funds and donors. Significant amounts of their budgets are spent researching and applying for grants, contacting donors, and building corporate relationships to insure their projects are funded. Smaller, community-focused non-profits are often overlooked and lose out to more publicly recognizable non-profits. And, if they want to promote how their current projects are doing, they are limited by the capabilities of their website and social media team, if they even have one.<\\/p><p>Imagine if you could bring both sides, funders and non-profits, to one place and meet all of those needs. Funders of any size (individuals, groups, corporations) can build their own giving programs to indicate specifically where they want their money to go. Non-Profts have all of their projects online and those projects are instantly matched to existing giving programs. &nbsp;Conversations and collaboration can happen on both sides, and once funded the projects can provide direct reports to their donors on progress and impact.<\\/p><p>There is an incredible scope to platform and I cannot discuss the details yet, but that is the seed at the core of it. We want to move beyond giving as it currently stands and allow it to be treated more as a professional investment.<\\/p><p>---<\\/p><p>When I joined the company as a developer at the end of November, I was only the fourth employee and was primarily hired because of my knowledge and experience with the&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/ellislab.com\\/codeigniter\\\">CodeIgniter<\\/a> framework, which I helped build during my time at EllisLab. Two weeks ago I was promoted to VP of Engineering and have finished an expansive API foundation for the entire platform using&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/laravel.com\\\">Laravel<\\/a>. &nbsp;The scope of our work, even at this initial launch phase, is simply mind bending. And our list of future enhancements and features is ambitious to say the least. &nbsp;<\\/p><p>To be frank, I took this job because my savings were so depleted after finishing the Pacific Crest Trail that any development position with enough challenge to keep me motivated would have done. Now, after helping to design and build not only the platform but the company itself, I have both an equity and personal investment in its success. There is a real chance that if the platform is successful this might be the last job I ever have. &nbsp;That is a statement I am still surprised to be uttering in public.<\\/p><p>The scars of 2012 still haunt me every day. &nbsp;As much as part of me desires to continue the path to becoming a doctor and making the world better that way, I can no longer find the will to plunge into that level of financial and temporal debt. I lost too much faith and became too greedy for a life without that level of sacrifice. But what I can do is use all of my technical skills to help build a company whose mission statement is explicit in its goal to make things better. &nbsp;Not sure how long I will resist the call of extreme outdoor adventures, but I do not mind at least allowing the possibility of sticking around for that.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"technology\"}}', '2014-05-31 19:16:47', '2015-01-17 19:43:04', '8b861d75-b73f-410c-a51d-d08a700f8864'),

I am not sure how to politely phrase it to them how <em>incredibly<\\/em> annoyed that makes me.  Every single day I am acutely aware that I have scar tissue in my tendon and missing articular cartilage on my patella. I habitually massage my knee whenever I sit down; almost as if subconsciously I believe I can rub the damage away.  My knee is never going to be \\\"good\\\" again.<\\/p><p>In all probability, gone are the days when I would run a half marathon before breakfast. Those intense trail running days where I would fly through the woods of Forest Park are likely behind me. Not only would attempting to run them be unpleasant, but my orthopedic surgeon believes it would cause more damage in the long term. Alas, the medical technology does not yet exist where we can reliably regrow cartilage and smooth scar tissue.<\\/p><p>Obviously, I can still be extremely active with it. Thanks to another month of physical therapy post-trail and constant exercises, I can reliably do three hour bike rides, swim two miles in the pool, and row nearly an hour on the erg without pain. Further, just last evening I was at the gym and after an hour of biking and rowing, I finally pulled off 200 lunges. If I am patient and slowly increase the length and difficulty of my exercises, I can strengthen my knees to a level where I can safely do mountaineering and full day bike rides, perhaps even on consecutive days.  Patience and commitment are key though.<\\/p><p>I love being active. Prior to my knee injury, I took a special joy in not giving a damn about races or training programs, yet still smoking serious athletes during runs or rides. Whenever people get too serious about stroking their egos, I get bored.  Who really cares about PRs? Did you have fun? Was there joy in what you did? Pushing yourself to the point of exhaustion and still grinning is one of the best feelings. Staring at a watch is ever so boring.<\\/p><p>Of course, I will never win a race. I lack the discipline and the requisite hardcore psychological quirk that drives athletic people to track their protein intake and heart rate. The idea of flying to another state to run 26.2 miles on pavement? Inconceivable.<\\/p><p>My workouts are meant for one thing and one thing only, to permit by body to do even more.

With only one sweaty hand on the handlebar, I slipped and slammed into my bike before ungracefully impacting the street. In a word, it was unpleasant; if we can suffer two words, it was fucking unpleasant.<\\/p><p>Nothing like bruises, abrasions, cuts, and a partially dislocated shoulder to start the weekend. The shoulder moseyed back into position after a minute or two, wherein I got my bike functional enough to get to the ZoomCare on Alberta. Alas, they had no open appointments, but a reliable stock of ibuprofen and cleansing pads were available for purchase. A half dozen of each, a few phone calls to friends, and I was whisked home in Dave\'s stately hybrid.<\\/p><p>The Hawthorne ZoomCare cleaned up my wounds with such a thorough scrubbing that I quickly admitted all of my past crimes and made up a few more to insure continued Congressional support. With a sling and stronger pain relievers as my companions, I scheduled an x-ray for the morning and went out for pizza. I am always a bit peckish after quarreling with composite surfaces.<\\/p><p>Spent most of Saturday in an exhausting pain and drug fueled haze of barely contained insensibility. I have a vague recollection of switching between grumbling, napping, and watching Batman cartoons for most of Sunday. Now things are much improved. A significant portion of the skin on my arm has returned with minimal scarring. The shoulder still aches, but movement is fully restored and the strength is steadily returning. No pull ups or pushups for a few weeks, but my lacrymal gland output remains steady.<\\/p><p>The most frustrating part is the inopportune timing. The workload and weather had converged to finally provide me with an excellent chance of climbing Mt. Hood or spending a long day in the Gorge biking. And even with a minor case of shin splints, my stair running up Tabor was proceeding exceptionally well. Not only did the bike crash annihilate my weekend plans, but I am going to spend the next month just returning to my previous level of activity. Again.<\\/p><p>This seems to be a repeating pattern in my life. It is a rare year in which I do not have some manner of accident or injury that incapacitates me and sets back months of work. Part of this is simply that I provide ample opportunities for the conspiring of probabilities. Spend enough time sprinting around a soccer pitch, running through the woods, or zooming down hills on a bike...and eventually you are not going to be paying attention at the right moment or get hit just right. I also have a tendency to be unforgiving in the intensity of my pursuits and also not allow sufficient time to recover.<\\/p><p>Being intensely physical is deeply ingrained into my person; I revel in it. Yet, my psychology has not caught up with the physical reality that I am a 35 year old male with three decades of injuries on the books. Concussions, broken bones, dislocations, strains, sprains, and plenty of scar tissue. And all of that damage is not going away; I am more prone to re-injury while my ability to bounce back is no longer that of a 20 year old. It is a problem.<\\/p><p>It is weird. I need to be careful; more deliberate and more patient. No more of the consequences be damned approach. I spend more time focusing efforts on stabilizing and preventing issues than kicking my ass. And as result of my previous assaults and offenses, parts of my body are regularly problematic when pushed too hard. It is quite a bother. I do not like it. One bit.<\\/p><p>It is quite a hassle getting older and living with the consequences of your youth, especially when your spirit refuses to accept that either need happen at all.

Even when an internal consensus is reached on a topic and an action taken, I will still reflect on it long after the fact and possibly reopen the floor to debate after a suitable amount of time has passed. It is a rare topic that has an edict against further deliberation.<\\/p><p>The recurrent one that I think most people can relate to is \\\"why am I here?\\\" Of course, at any given moment it might refer broadly to my continued existence on our fair planet or narrowly as to who I am socializing with at a certain time and place. It is a tricky thing constantly questioning each of your motivations, probable consequences of your actions, and willingness to accept those consequences. Something as simple as meeting a friend for breakfast will occupy a prime place on the carousel of my thoughts for days beforehand. <\\/p><p>Because of that carousel, I rarely take action without being acutely aware of the influence that a choice may have on my life. Of course, I am exceedingly aware of how chaotic and unpredictable life is. You can ruminate as frequently and deeply as you wish, but you will never see the complete patterns of consequence until they are well behind you.

There are absolutely no promises in life. Even if you believe in a God or gods, there is no guarantee you will get safety, comfort, or happiness. The Universe is rather ambivalent towards your needs and wants. For some, that realization means they seize onto whatever feels the most stable. That is not so much my public modus operandi.<\\/p><p>Which is odd because I do not consider myself reckless or even particularly impressive in my accomplishments. Instead, I consider most everyone else timid and lazy. How can you possibly go through life wanting more and knowing you should do more, and then not do it?  As a well known Dutch author once said: It\'s maddening; I get mad about it.<\\/p><p>I have a tendency to think of my life as a narrative. There are certain themes and rules that I tend to follow, and I aim my actions to fall within those lines. I obsess over my decisions and carefully evaluate how I want to act, but once a decision is reached I take action. Discovering the \\\"should\\\" is the hard part, taking action is easy for me.<\\/p><p>I grant there is a certain cold, clinical approach in how I disregard emotional considerations and physical comforts when I believe an action is called for. Breakups are emotionally painful, but if it is necessary there is no reason to delay. Leaving your warm, dry tent and getting moving in cold, wet conditions is unpleasant but you must leave and start hiking. I understand that others are motivated by these considerations in varying degrees, I really do, they just rarely affect my own actions; they lack potency.<\\/p><p>I think our culture is making progress on accepting that there are a wide range of behaviors in humans.

With only one sweaty hand on the handlebar, I slipped and slammed into my bike before ungracefully impacting the street. In a word, it was unpleasant; if we can suffer two words, it was fucking unpleasant.<\\/p><p>Nothing like bruises, abrasions, cuts, and a partially dislocated shoulder to start the weekend. The shoulder moseyed back into position after a minute or two, wherein I got my bike functional enough to get to the ZoomCare on Alberta. Alas, they had no open appointments, but a reliable stock of ibuprofen and cleansing pads were available for purchase. A half dozen of each, a few phone calls to friends, and I was whisked home in Dave\'s stately hybrid.<\\/p><p>The Hawthorne ZoomCare cleaned up my wounds with such a thorough scrubbing that I quickly admitted all of my past crimes and made up a few more to insure continued Congressional support. With a sling and stronger pain relievers as my companions, I scheduled an x-ray for the morning and went out for pizza. I am always a bit peckish after quarreling with composite surfaces.<\\/p><p>Spent most of Saturday in an exhausting pain and drug fueled haze of barely contained insensibility. I have a vague recollection of switching between grumbling, napping, and watching Batman cartoons for most of Sunday. Now things are much improved. A significant portion of the skin on my arm has returned with minimal scarring. The shoulder still aches, but movement is fully restored and the strength is steadily returning. No pull ups or pushups for a few weeks, but my lacrymal gland output remains steady.<\\/p><p>The most frustrating part is the inopportune timing. The workload and weather had converged to finally provide me with an excellent chance of climbing Mt. Hood or spending a long day in the Gorge biking. And even with a minor case of shin splints, my stair running up Tabor was proceeding exceptionally well. Not only did the bike crash annihilate my weekend plans, but I am going to spend the next month just returning to my previous level of activity. Again.<\\/p><p>This seems to be a repeating pattern in my life. It is a rare year in which I do not have some manner of accident or injury that incapacitates me and sets back months of work. Part of this is simply that I provide ample opportunities for the conspiring of probabilities. Spend enough time sprinting around a soccer pitch, running through the woods, or zooming down hills on a bike...and eventually you are not going to be paying attention at the right moment or get hit just right. I also have a tendency to be unforgiving in the intensity of my pursuits and also not allow sufficient time to recover.<\\/p><p>Being intensely physical is deeply ingrained into my person; I revel in it. Yet, my psychology has not caught up with the physical reality that I am a 35 year old male with three decades of injuries on the books. Concussions, broken bones, dislocations, strains, sprains, and plenty of scar tissue. And all of that damage is not going away; I am more prone to re-injury while my ability to bounce back is no longer that of a 20 year old. It is a problem.<\\/p><p>It is weird. I need to be careful; more deliberate and more patient. No more of the consequences be damned approach. I spend more time focusing efforts on stabilizing and preventing issues than kicking my ass. And as result of my previous assaults and offenses, parts of my body are regularly problematic when pushed too hard. It is quite a bother. I do not like it. One bit.<\\/p><p>It is quite a hassle getting older and living with the consequences of your youth, especially when your spirit refuses to accept that either need happen at all.  At the same time, given the chance to relive my teens and twenties, I would do it all again but perhaps even harder.

This first one will be about the big three of backpacking: the pack, the sleeping bag, and the tent. All totaled, these three items were 4.9 pounds of my base weight and cost $975.00.  Definitely earning the name Big Three as that is a third of my base weight and about half of my gear cost.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.amazon.com\\/Big-Agnes-Copper-Ultralight-Backpacking\\/dp\\/B00224Z7QE\\/ref=sr_1_1?tag=reedmaniaccom-20\\\">Big Agnes Copper Spur UL1<\\/a><\\/strong><strong><br>\\r\\n\\t<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/shapelesschaos.com\\/assets\\/uploads\\/tent.png\\\" style=\\\"width:640px;height:auto;\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tI originally started out with a Tarptent Contrail, which Amelia greatly loved, but I found myself becoming more and more annoyed during the first couple weeks thanks to the wind storms and poor staking conditions; to the point that there were situations where I really should have put up my tent but I did not want to trouble myself. Not a good sign, so I ordered the Big Agnes Copper Spur UL 1 at the Big Bear Lake hostel and had it delivered to The Saufleys in Agua Dulce.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tChose the Copper Spur for a few reasons.  It is a free standing tent, has a side vestibule (compared to the front vestibule on the Fly Creek), and is longer than the Fly Creek (I am 6\'1\\\").  The weight was around half a pound heavier than the Contrail, but I got a tent that would not collapse under wind or snow, had slightly more head room, and if it was a gorgeous night and I just wanted bug protection I could still see the moon, stars, and the occasional meteor shower.  Was pleased with my choice.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Sturdy, free-standing, easy to stake, simple setup, great for buggy environments, dries super-quick, and tough.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons:<\\/strong> Bit heavier than most UL options, comfortable but not roomy for a large guy, rather pricey if you do not have a famous REI 20% coupon.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended. I was happy with my choice.  Might be tempted to try another ultralight option in the future though (ex: <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.zpacks.com\\/shelter\\/hexamid_plus.shtml\\\">Hexamid<\\/a>), if I had spare cash, as the weight did bug me a bit.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.zpacks.com\\/quilts\\/sleepingbag.shtml\\\">ZPacks 20 Degree Down Sleeping Bag<\\/a> (Wide, X-Long)<\\/strong><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/shapelesschaos.com\\/assets\\/uploads\\/green_quilt_top_l.jpg\\\" style=\\\"width:640px;height:auto;\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tLike many thru-hikers, I did my research and was intending to use a \\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.backcountry.com\\/western-mountaineering-ultralite-sleeping-bag-20-degree-down-wes0031\\\">Western Mountaineering Ultralite down sleeping bag<\\/a>. Right towards the end of the trip planning phase, while reading Yet Another Hiking Blog (YAHB), I discovered ZPacks.  The Western Mountaineering Ultralite long was 31 oz, while the ZPacks Wide, X-Long was only 21.7 oz.  And it was cheaper.  The ZPacks bag is basically what happens when a down quilt and a down sleeping bag have a baby, with a couple genetic enhancements.  It was fantastic.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe only real downside really had to do with the trail itself. Quite often a 20 degree bag was overkill in the desert.  And yet, three days later that bag could be indispensable when a freezing cold night happened. Washington rained on us almost a third of the times, so  I protected my sleeping bag by putting it inside a trash bag inside a cuben sack inside the trash compactor bag lined part of my pack.  Even with that, a handful of times it got a bit damp while unstuffed in my tent.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Pros:<\\/strong> Warm, lightweight, compressible, did not cover my head (I suffer from anti-mummy tendencies and prefer a hat), worked great as a blanket.  When it was really cold, it was AMAZING!<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Cons: <\\/strong>Expensive. Bit too warm for about half of California. Constant vigilance required in Washington to keep it dry.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Bottom Line:<\\/strong> Recommended.  If I had to do it again, I might consider using a higher degree bag and then carrying a liner for the Sierras and Washington.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<strong><a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/gossamergear.com\\/packs\\/backpacks\\/mariposa-ultralight-backpack-all.html\\\">Gossamer Gear Mariposa<\\/a><\\/strong><sub><br>\\r\\n\\t<\\/sub><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"{asset:117:url}\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSadly, I do not have a good shot of myself using this backpack in the wild. Typically I was carrying it on my back, so I suppose that is not completely unexpected. Stock photo to the rescue!<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tProbably one of the pieces of ultralight gear I was most skeptical about.  Currently, I have four other backpacks that I use for all variety of purposes: guiding, mountaineering, quick summit hops from basecamp, et cetera.  For me a pack needs to hold the right amount of gear comfortably for days while making my gear easily accessible.  Surely a pack that ways less than 2 pounds could not handle all of the trials of a thru-hike.  <em>I was wrong.<\\/em>  Except for when it was overloaded with a bear canister and\\/or 6-7 days worth of food, it worked perfectly.  It was meant to carry 35 pounds or less, and I think that is spot on.  Go over that and your pack (and you) will suffer for it.

Got to do everything from vehicle extrication at one of the local firehouses to relearning neonatal care (not so common in the backcountry, oddly). This training insured all of my <em>urban<\\/em> EMT skills were up to snuff. &nbsp;March and April were a busy couple months as I was working full time and training\\/planning for the PCT too. &nbsp;But, all of the required paperwork and signatures were sent off a few weeks ago so I am not yet recertified but I am certifiable, again.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tWith all of this training, knowledge, and experience building a lightweight first aid kit for a 2,600+ mile hike is a Herculean battle between two opposing desires. &nbsp;How much weight is too much vs. what items are worth the weight given my skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I led outdoor trips, most organization-provided first aid kits that were around 5 pounds and were one lawyer recommendation away from containing an <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Automated_external_defibrillator\\\">AED<\\/a>. &nbsp;On my own backpacking trips I usually have a first aid kit between a pound to a pound and a half that is meant to prevent an uncomfortable or problematic situation from becoming a <em>really <\\/em>bad day.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tAmelia commented when she saw my completed kit that I built this PCT first aid kit not for me but for everyone else on the trail, despite the fact that I do not particularly like most people and head into the wilderness to escape civilization. I am funny like that.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSince the PCT crosses many towns, roads, and campsites, there will be both urban and wilderness medical situations possible. &nbsp;The balance I tried to strike was between light and capable of handling the most likely scenarios, while not regretting what I could have carried but did not for weight reasons. &nbsp;Tough. &nbsp;And like all things, I will likely adjust it on the way.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe kit includes the following:&nbsp;Ace bandage, gauze roll, athletic tape, NSAID pain relievers, gloves + CPR face shield, moleskin, tweezers, pins, Benadryl, backup water purification tablets, QuikClot, triangle bandage, SecondSkin blister pads, bandaids, gauze pads. All for only <strong>9.5 oz<\\/strong> total, which is about the weight of 1.2 cups of water. &nbsp;<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/shapelesschaos.com\\/assets\\/uploads\\/first_aid_kit.png\\\" style=\\\"width:640px;height:auto;\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe majority of the what I have treated in the backcountry are blisters and musculoskeletal injuries &nbsp;There have been a few decent bleeds and cuts but nothing that a bit of gauze and tape cannot handle. &nbsp;So, I went with a half dozen blister pads, enough gauze to handle a few decent bleeds, and ace bandage + triangle bandage. &nbsp;Sure I could improvise something for the ace bandage or triangle bandage, but I have yet to meet a trained professional who would not greatly prefer to have it provided. &nbsp;Tape, pain relievers, tweezers, pins, and allergy meds are all lightweight, handy, and are pretty hard to improvise. &nbsp;Ever tried to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/wwwchem.csustan.edu\\/consumer\\/aspirincons\\/aspirincons.htm\\\">synthesize aspirin<\\/a> in the wilderness? Not easy, my friends.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe gloves, CPR face shield and QuikClot are meant more for urban or semi-urban problems. &nbsp;In the back of my mind, I can just imagine hitching into town and seeing a car accident or having a respiratory or cardiac arrest at a campground. &nbsp;For their weight, they could realistically mean the difference between life and death. &nbsp;They could be the first things to go too as those scenarios seem the least likely.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tFor the weight of just over a cup of water, I feel pretty good about this kit. &nbsp;Anything else I might conceivably want, I can improvise (healing power of laughter!), find on the way (<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.rei.com\\/product\\/407010\\/tecnu-oak-n-ivy-cleanser\\\">Tecnu<\\/a>), or it would be far heavier than I would be willing to carry (oxygen tank).<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2014-12-29 04:38:26', '2015-01-17 19:43:04', '07493c24-8439-416d-85f1-d5f3c660c9f7'),

I also included links to the product\'s website, Amazon, and REI to help readers get a range of information and reviews.  That being said, I shopped around and found quite a number of discounts from the likes of <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.geartrade.com\\\">GearTrade<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/backcountry.com\\\">Backcountry.com<\\/a>, <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/ebay.com\\\">eBay<\\/a>, and <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.sierratradingpost.com\\\">Sierra Trading Post<\\/a>.  Thus, the prices listed at those sites will likely not match my \\\"purchased cost\\\" for each item.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tDespite having quite a plethora of gear already, unfortunately most of it is meant for activities like mountaineering and snow camping.  Not exactly lightweight.  So, I bit the bullet and bought new, ultralight versions of a shelter, sleeping bag\\/pad, and pack for a rather hefty cost of $995.  Yet, by buying those four items instead of using what I already owned, I reduced my base pack weight by over five pounds.  Considering the time and distance, I felt that was a worthwhile investment. After the big four, my next four largest purchases were a JetBoil Sol Titanium stove, a solar charger, and my hiking shirt and pants.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tJetBoil Sol Titanium.  While it seems the hip\\/cool ultralight PCT backpacker uses an \\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/jwbasecamp.com\\/Articles\\/SuperCat\\/\\\">alcohol stove<\\/a>, I simply could not get excited about using one. I know that when I cook while backpacking, I am usually about one evolutionary leap away from caveman and want my food <em><strong>now<\\/strong><\\/em>. Also did not like having to concern myself with alcohol measuring, the lack of simmering, and instability.  This new JetBoil boils 2 cups of water in about a minute, which is the perfect amount of water for most of my dinners, while a fuel cannister should last around two weeks.  Doubt I will regret this decision.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSolar Charger. We are in the age of technology. Our smartphones are camera, GPS, web browser, app platform, and phone all in one.  The sCharger-5 Solar Charger is hopefully going to help me keep my iPhone powered. It was highly recommended by a few PCT hikers last year and my initial tests have shown it to be quite the little power delivery device when there is full sun.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tHiking Shirt and Bottom.  I am not sure where I initially heard about \\r\\n\\t<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.railriders.com\\\">RailRiders<\\/a>, but the more I read the more it looked like their clothes would be ideal for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.  Lightweight, ventilated, quick drying, and long lasting.  One of my more blind faith gear choices, but sometimes you need to rely on a good feeling and hope it turns out to be right.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tEverything else is reasonably standard or self explanatory.  I am sure with more money\\r\\n\\t<em>,<\\/em> research<em>, and<\\/em> sacrificing of comfort, I could reduce my base weight another 3 pounds and perhaps even have found cheaper items.  But, for now I am reasonably content with my choices.

So, I am estimating that I will need to consume at least 5,000 calories a day for the entire trip, minimum. &nbsp;To give you some perspective on what would be required to intake that many calories, here are a few foods and the quantities required to reach 5,000 calories (<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/nutritiondata.self.com\\\">source<\\/a>):\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Olive Oil - 42 Tablesppons<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Peanut Butter - 53 Tablespoons<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Snickers - 18.5 regular bars<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Whole Almonds - 6 cups (1.9 lbs)<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Dried Quinoa - 8 cups (3 lbs)<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Muesli - 17 cups (3.2 lbs)<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThe foods listed there are considered relatively calorie dense for their weight too. &nbsp;The average PCT thru-hiker will be consuming about 2-2.5 pounds of food a day and even then most will lose 5-15 pounds of weight during their trip. &nbsp;I am a fairly lean guy already, so the process of keeping my body fueled and healthy is in the forefront of my thoughts now that all of my gear is purchased and ready.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tWhile the calorie quantity and weight of the food is important, it also has to meet all the nutritional requirements that the strain of the trail puts on your body. &nbsp;An often cited resource for thru hikers is&nbsp;Dr. Braaten\'s&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/thru-hiker.com\\/articles\\/pack_light_eat_right.php\\\">Pack Light, Eat Right<\\/a> website. &nbsp;She covers everything from protein content to vitamins, as well as some recommended foods and recipes. &nbsp;Thankfully, as Amelia frequently says, I am a good eater. &nbsp;Put food in front of me and I will eat it. Even on mountains and in cold weather, my mind is so used to eating on a constant basis that even if I am not feeling hungry I am programmed to continue putting anything consumable within reach into my mouth.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tThat being said, I do appreciate having a hot, tasty meal that has absolutely nothing to do with energy bars, trail mix, soup mixes, or potato flakes. &nbsp;Since I am being resupplied five times via mail drop while in California, those boxes seemed like a perfect time to throw in a half dozen lightweight backpacking meals. &nbsp;Researching a half dozen dried and freeze dried meal companies online, I settled on&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/outdoorherbivore.com\\\">Outdoor Herbivore<\\/a>. &nbsp;Their meals looked the most appetizing and were extremely price competitive compared to a company like Mountain House. &nbsp;They also have a fantastic 15%&nbsp;bulk discount on orders over $200, which sealed the deal. &nbsp;I went through their website last Monday and chose twelve different meals, which were delivered at the end of last week:\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/shapelesschaos.com\\/assets\\/uploads\\/food.png\\\" style=\\\"width:640px;height:auto;\\\">\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tBought two Hungry Double sized packages of the following meals:\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>AppalaChia<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Bee Good Couscous<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Blackened Quinoa<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Cheddar\' Mac<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Chia Oat Crunch<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Coconut Chia Peel<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Ginger Chia Gooey<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Naked Freckle Burrito<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Savory Lentil Simmer<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Sunny Sunflower Salad<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Switchback Soup & Stuffer<\\/li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Toasted Sunburst Muesli<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\tIf you want to see how the different meals compare on price\\/weight\\/calories, I created a&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/shapelesschaos.com\\/assets\\/uploads\\/Outdoor_Herbivore.pdf\\\">spreadsheet<\\/a> that breaks it all down. &nbsp;Even with their excellent prices, if I bought only these meals for the entirety of my trip, the cost to feed me for the entire trip would be approximately $4,400. &nbsp;That is <em>not<\\/em> including any money I spent on restaurant food during zero mileage days in town. &nbsp;Bit pricey. &nbsp;But for the occasional treat during mail resupply, I think they are going to be extremely welcomed.&nbsp;\\r\\n<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2014-12-29 04:46:49', '2015-01-17 19:43:05', '28fc3882-a07f-4ff7-9b9a-c87f943b4f88'),

That indicates to me that we are going to have a bumper crop of hikers this year.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tHonestly, I think I have a 50\\/50 chance of finishing the first month, mostly depending on how my body reacts to the stresses of 20+ mile days and caloric deprivation. &nbsp;With my knee being my greatest anxiety. &nbsp;If I make it that first month, I think that one month shakedown cruise will prove I am physically capable and I should be golden the rest of the way.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tStill, there are other things I am keeping an eye on...<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe Sierras are experiencing their second low snow year in a row with the average \\\"<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/cdec.water.ca.gov\\/cgi-progs\\/reports\\/PLOT_SWC.2013\\\">Snow Water Content<\\/a>\\\" being around 50% of normal. &nbsp;While that bodes well for crossing the high passes, it is a bit more problematic when you remember that the melting snow feeds the water sources at lower elevations. &nbsp;It is a balancing act that has thru-hikers aiming to enter the Sierras around June 15th during an average snow year. &nbsp;According to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/postholer.com\\\">Postholer<\\/a> the recommended date for entering the Sierras this year is <em>June 5th<\\/em>. &nbsp;I am continually glancing at the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.pctwater.com\\\">PCT Water Report<\\/a> website, and the current reports make me think that I will be essentially traveling between spigots and water tanks in parts of Southern California (spigot hopping!). &nbsp;And, there are definitely going to be days when I start with 6 litres of water in my pack. &nbsp;In hot desert weather that 13 pounds are going to make my days significantly tougher. &nbsp;But, one does need to drink. &nbsp;Here\'s hoping for a spring storm or two.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tSpeaking of water, or lack thereof, California and Oregon seem to be rather prone to forest fires in the summer. &nbsp;When I was section hiking the PCT between Sisters, Oregon and Cascade Locks five years ago, I remember seeing hills covered in blackened, dead trees and walking through a burnt patch that was still smoldering. &nbsp;They actually recommended not entering the Jefferson Wilderness at all.&nbsp;<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/shapelesschaos.com\\/assets\\/uploads\\/notice-of-wildfires.png\\\" style=\\\"height:640px;width:auto;\\\"><\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThankfully, a lovely storm system came in and doused pretty much everyone for three days in cold, miserable rain. &nbsp;So, a section of the trail could easily be closed off because of fires. &nbsp;Flip flopping or skipping to return later might be an option, but if things go poorly it could mean not finishing the entire trail. &nbsp;The decrease in the Forest Service\'s <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.usatoday.com\\/story\\/news\\/nation\\/2013\\/03\\/25\\/drought-wildfires-forest-service\\/2019743\\/\\\">fire fighting budget<\\/a> because of the sequester is not encouraging.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tAnd finally and most likely, there are injuries and mental\\/physical exhaustion. &nbsp;I am a big fan of North Star and Shutterbug\'s&nbsp;<a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/wanderingthewild.com\\\">Wandering the Wild<\\/a> website. These two PCT alums just started hiking the Appalachian Trail and right off the bat Shutterbug developed a knee problem. &nbsp;Shin splints, twisted ankles, knee pain: the trail is unkind and a problematic injury can happen to <em>anyone<\\/em>. &nbsp;Combine a painful injury with long days and not enough food, and it is enough to make anyone quit. &nbsp;I hear Northern California with its relative lack of towns is particularly problematic for people. &nbsp;I know that I for one have a hard time reining myself in and could easily burn out or break down by not taking adequate rest days.<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tNone of these are huge, worrisome concerns but they are on the back burner in my mind. &nbsp;Expectations are an important part of making a long trip go well and I am trying to manage them as best I can before starting off.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2014-12-29 04:51:15', '2015-01-17 19:43:05', 'bab6963a-a2e7-4d10-89fe-1c338f92fded'),

Instead of fresh snow, we have been getting more rain and plenty of melting.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"http:\\/\\/shapelesschaos.com\\/assets\\/uploads\\/government-camp-temps.png#asset:151:url\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" style=\\\"display: block; margin: auto;\\\"><br>\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tAnd here\'s the kicker, it is going to get worse. Much much worse. The whole reason I wrote this entry was because my housemate recently got me into \\r\\n\\t<i>The Newsroom<\\/i> and a week ago we saw an episode that dealt with climate change. For a quick recap, checkout the Mother Jones <a data-mce-href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.motherjones.com\\/blue-marble\\/2014\\/11\\/climate-desk-fact-checks-aaron-sorkins-climate-science-newsroom\\\" href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.motherjones.com\\/blue-marble\\/2014\\/11\\/climate-desk-fact-checks-aaron-sorkins-climate-science-newsroom\\\">fact check article<\\/a> on the episode.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tWatching the episode was painful because while you felt smacked down by its heavy-handed treatment of the material, the reality is that it was completely right. We have had this research in our hands for \\r\\n\\t<i>decades,<\\/i> yet as a species we have not even applied the brakes. This is happening, it is extremely bad, and the majority of people are paying little to no attention. In the United States more than half of our representatives are actively blocking any attempt to even accept that climate change is human caused.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\tThe scale of the problem is immense. Greater than anything we have ever faced. And so, we choose not to face it.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\n\\t<br data-mce-bogus=\\\"1\\\">\\r\\n<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"science\"}}', '2015-01-30 06:59:51', '2015-01-30 06:59:51', '279e5bac-7417-4b13-b3cc-a3bba7597337'),

I rather like admiring other people\'s stuff.  I just do not like having stuff myself. As a thought exercise, I wondered if I would be so against stuff if I had a TARDIS to put it in. A ship that could move easily through all of time and space. Your stuff would never be in the way, it would never need to be moved to another house\\/apartment, and you could always have it with you. I think the answer is I would be perfectly ok with collecting and owning more things if that were the case. What bothers me about stuff is having to deal with it. It is a weight around your life and prohibits flexibility and options. Harder to move and harder to move on with it.<\\/p><p>That is part of the romanticism of a life of travel and thru-hiking. You only take one you need. You can go anywhere with what you have on your person. A very significant part of me wants impermanence. And that is why I am saving money.<\\/p>\",\"3\":\"pct\"}}', '2015-02-14 21:33:14', '2015-02-14 21:33:14', '699d1353-92a6-4b60-ae2b-1d6a927cbb56'),

I am unemployed. I am homeless. And, I have no idea where I will eventually end up.<\\/p><p>Part of me is trying to work itself up and feel at least a little excitement or perhaps panic. It does not seem to be coming though. I suspect if I had not spent five months hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, it would be significantly easier to be concerned about this new, uncertain path I am taking. But I have stepped into this sort of unknown before. Multiple times. Everything always seems to work itself out. I trust myself to find a solution to whatever problems or cockamamie situations I put myself into. There is a deep-rooted satisfaction in being confident enough in your will and wit to simply break ranks, bail on the comfortable, and be a little foolhardy.<\\/p><p>Most everyone has been supportive of me once again quitting my job and running off (except my recent work mates, which is expected, I suppose, given the culture there). I should not be particularly surprised by their support and well wishes, yet I still am. There is definitely a disconnect between how I see myself and how others seem me that I am frequently trying to reconcile.<\\/p><p>Reviewing my behavior and ascribing those characteristics to a fictional third person is helpful in glimpsing how others see me. What if I knew a friend who was quitting a <em>very<\\/em> well-paying job for a third time and aiming to be an adventure bum for a summer. Who eschews adult behaviors like buying a home, having a career, and putting down roots. Who has whittled down his possessions to a single car load. Who rarely dates and cannot think of a single real world example of a relationship that would even work with his personality. And then every chance he gets is trying to convince others that they too can break the chains of modern American life and work to live a better, more interesting life, if they just have the courage.<\\/p><p>I would expect that guy to run off and be perfectly ok. Seems worth knowing too. On the inside though, I am always questioning these little odysseys of mine. Why can I not find a job\\/relationship\\/life that makes me want to settle down and relax a bit? Is this mad itch in my brain ever going to lessen? How can someone with this much intelligence and promise keep on tossing away opportunities to build a stable life?<\\/p><p>So incredibly serious. So incredibly non-adult. No sane person leaves a job as CTO to live out of his car. No sane person sits in a chair for 50+ hours a week when there is an amazing world out there to explore. Conflict. Opposing thoughts. Etc.<\\/p><p>I know why I do it, why I run off. I really do. There is so much to see and do! The adult life I see most others living is not enough. How can you be satisfied with that <em>status quo<\\/em>? It\'s so...simple and routine. Where is the challenge? Where are the experiences that you will look back upon and grin like a mad idiot?<\\/p><p>And that is who I am. I want a life where my blood is pumping and not just circulating. Where stories and memories worthy of song and campfires happen regularly. If that means I have to cut strings occasionally and let go of stability, so be it. I am still conflicted about it though.

Some of the berries were that distinctive dark bluish-purple that I have always considered huckleberries while others were definitely the color and shape of domesticated blueberries.  Our guide from Oregon Wild said a botanist had informed her that all of them were huckleberries. I was not exactly convinced. The leaves were very similar in shape but the branches looked different in color and the berries were obviously very different in color and somewhat in size too.<\\/p><p>While hiking up to Old Snowy, the same thing happened.  Two similar looking plants but with obviously different berries. While absorbing the blessed fruits of the internet (mmmm, YouTube!), I decided to do a few Google searches and finally solve this mystery to my satisfaction. Not all of the links are helpful, but here was the ah-ha moment: <\\/p><blockquote><strong>Western Huckleberries<\\/strong><br>Like their blueberry brethren, Western huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) have five chambers in the ovary. Both the flowers and fruit look similar to blueberries, but Western huckleberries produce single berries rather than clusters, where their leaves join the stem, and bear fruit on new shoots. Huckleberries resist domestication, so they are harvested from the wild. A single plant yields less than a blueberry plant would, but each fruit contains intense flavor-causing chemicals, making it more flavorful. The black huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum) is widely harvested for its black, purple or red fruit. Cascade huckleberry\'s (Vaccinium deliciosum) bright blue berries are, as its species name suggests, delicious. Both grow in USDA zones 4 through 8. <br><br>Source: <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ehow.com\\/facts_5782453_difference-between-blueberries-huckleberries_.html\\\">ehow.com<br><\\/a><\\/blockquote><p>Finally having the scientific names proved extremely helpful.

Some of the berries were that distinctive dark bluish-purple that I have always considered huckleberries while others were definitely the color and shape of domesticated blueberries.  Our guide from Oregon Wild said a botanist had informed her that all of them were huckleberries. I was not exactly convinced. The leaves were very similar in shape but the branches looked different in color and the berries were obviously very different in color and somewhat in size too.<\\/p><p>While hiking up to Old Snowy, the same thing happened.  Two similar looking plants but with obviously different berries. While absorbing the blessed fruits of the internet (mmmm, YouTube!), I decided to do a few Google searches and finally solve this mystery to my satisfaction. Not all of the links are helpful, but here was the ah-ha moment: <\\/p><blockquote><strong>Western Huckleberries<\\/strong><br>Like their blueberry brethren, Western huckleberries (Vaccinium spp.) have five chambers in the ovary. Both the flowers and fruit look similar to blueberries, but Western huckleberries produce single berries rather than clusters, where their leaves join the stem, and bear fruit on new shoots. Huckleberries resist domestication, so they are harvested from the wild. A single plant yields less than a blueberry plant would, but each fruit contains intense flavor-causing chemicals, making it more flavorful. The black huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum) is widely harvested for its black, purple or red fruit. Cascade huckleberry\'s (Vaccinium deliciosum) bright blue berries are, as its species name suggests, delicious. Both grow in USDA zones 4 through 8. <br><br>Source: <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.ehow.com\\/facts_5782453_difference-between-blueberries-huckleberries_.html\\\">ehow.com<br><\\/a><\\/blockquote><p>Finally having the scientific names proved extremely helpful. Wikipedia has entries on both <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Vaccinium_deliciosum\\\">Vaccinium deliciosum<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/en.wikipedia.org\\/wiki\\/Vaccinium_membranaceum\\\">Vaccinium membranaceum<\\/a> with photos easily found via a Google images search.

They can be described as both!  Of course, from now on, I think I am just going to call one the Mountain Huckleberry and the other Cascade Blueberry.

It stopped in Petersburg, which was only about 12 minutes away by plane.  Up...and then down.  Then another 50 minutes or so to Juneau.  Along the way the view on the right side of the plane was the Juneau Icefield and it was <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20240059573\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">jaw dropping<\\/a>. Thanks to a conversation on the plane, I shared a cab into downtown with a pilot for one of the cruise lines.

Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind\\/rain was blowing at me in an abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water had found its way in along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it somehow exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubbled feeding, diving, and even a breach. There are videos but they really do not do the experience justice. <\\/p><p><br>Thanks to a ferry breaking down, another ferry not running because of severe weather, and an overcrowded hostel I took a flight to Sitka the next morning. Numerous people had expounded on the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had it Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new hours with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me at that cafe, made even more powerful by the Free box on the porch containing a VHS set of Star Trek movies.  On the way to the hostel I passed a community library built to resemble a TARDIS. <\\/p><p><br>The hostel did not open until 6pm, so I walked over to the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskaraptor.org\\/\\\">Alaska Raptor Center<\\/a>, which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teach the public about Alaska\'s raptor population.  Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.  The entrance had two owls <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20238735164\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">greeting visitors<\\/a> and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds. All the birds have names and classrooms around the world can \\\"adopt\\\" a bird and receive materials and lessons about the raptors.  I wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all.<\\/p><p>The next day I had planned on going for a hike up behind Sitka to the summit of Gavan Hill.  However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous in these conditions.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good conditions, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail and beyond, and then gotten trapped when the waters receded.  Still, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.  The smell of a healthy, thriving forest is not to be beat.  And even miles up the trail, we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn.<\\/p><p>By the end of that hike though, I definitely needed to do a bit of laundry.  And I finally decided that my shoes had to go. They had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain, mud, salt water, and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even I was finding them too much.  An outfitter in town serendipitously had a nice pair of Brooks in my size for 40% off too.<\\/p><p>The next day Sitka brought out the pretty.  A bit of rain in the morning but then partly cloudy and sunny the rest of the day.  I grabbed my book and made the most of it by simply lounging around town.  My tendency to go full bore meant I had not taken a day off for the entire trip just to recover and enjoy the scenery.  Remedied that.  Saw quite a bit of wildlife too, including two <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20868579641\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">sea lions having dinner<\\/a> in the marina.<\\/p><p>That night I reviewed my credit card balance and decided that after an intense two week whirlwind through SE Alaska that it was time to head back south and start thinking about finding employment once more.

Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind\\/rain was blowing at me in an abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water had found its way in along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it somehow exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubbled feeding, diving, and even a breach. There are videos but they really do not do the experience justice. <\\/p><p><br>Thanks to a ferry breaking down, another ferry not running because of severe weather, and an overcrowded hostel I took a flight to Sitka the next morning. Numerous people had expounded on the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had it Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new hours with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me at that cafe, made even more powerful by the Free box on the porch containing a VHS set of Star Trek movies.  On the way to the hostel I passed a community library built to resemble a TARDIS. <\\/p><p><br>The hostel did not open until 6pm, so I walked over to the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskaraptor.org\\/\\\">Alaska Raptor Center<\\/a>, which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teach the public about Alaska\'s raptor population.  Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.  The entrance had two owls <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20238735164\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">greeting visitors<\\/a> and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds. All the birds have names and classrooms around the world can \\\"adopt\\\" a bird and receive materials and lessons about the raptors.  I wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all.<\\/p><p>The next day I had planned on going for a hike up behind Sitka to the summit of Gavan Hill.  However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous in these conditions.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good conditions, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail and beyond, and then gotten trapped when the waters receded.  Still, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.  The smell of a healthy, thriving forest is not to be beat.  And even miles up the trail, we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn.<\\/p><p>By the end of that hike though, I definitely needed to do a bit of laundry.  And I finally decided that my shoes had to go. They had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain, mud, salt water, and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even I was finding them too much.  An outfitter in town serendipitously had a nice pair of Brooks in my size for 40% off too.<\\/p><p>The next day Sitka brought out the pretty.  A bit of rain in the morning but then partly cloudy and sunny the rest of the day.  I grabbed my book and made the most of it by simply lounging around town.

Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind\\/rain was blowing at me in an abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water had found its way in along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it somehow exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubbled feeding, diving, and even a breach. There are videos but they really do not do the experience justice. <\\/p><p><br>Thanks to a ferry breaking down, another ferry not running because of severe weather, and an overcrowded hostel I took a flight to Sitka the next morning. Numerous people had expounded on the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had it Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new hours with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me at that cafe, made even more powerful by the Free box on the porch containing a VHS set of Star Trek movies.  On the way to the hostel I passed a community library built to resemble a TARDIS. <\\/p><p><br>The hostel did not open until 6pm, so I walked over to the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskaraptor.org\\/\\\">Alaska Raptor Center<\\/a>, which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teach the public about Alaska\'s raptor population.  Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.  The entrance had two owls <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20238735164\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">greeting visitors<\\/a> and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds. All the birds have names and classrooms around the world can \\\"adopt\\\" a bird and receive materials and lessons about the raptors.  I wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all.<\\/p><p>The next day I had planned on going for a hike up behind Sitka to the summit of Gavan Hill.  However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous in these conditions.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good conditions, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail and beyond, and then gotten trapped when the waters receded.  Still, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.  The smell of a healthy, thriving forest is not to be beat.  And even miles up the trail, we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn.<\\/p><p>By the end of that hike though, I definitely needed to do a bit of laundry.  And I finally decided that my shoes had to go. They had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain, mud, salt water, and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even I was finding them too much.  An outfitter in town serendipitously had a nice pair of Brooks in my size for 40% off too.<\\/p><p>The next day Sitka brought out the pretty.  A bit of rain in the morning but then partly cloudy and sunny the rest of the day.  I grabbed my book and made the most of it by simply lounging around town.

Camping on the deck worked reasonably well for the first night but then the continuous dampness and wind loosened the duct tape a bit too much and nearly everyone moved inside the solariums. Saved us from hearing the ship\'s fog horn early in the mornings too.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>Ketchikan lived up to its reputation of the First City (that cruise lines stop at) and being one of the rainiest cities in America. Did all the general touristy things from visiting the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/alaskacenters.gov\\/ketchikan.cfm\\\">Southeast Alaska Discovery Center<\\/a> to watching the salmon spawn up near Creek Street to seeing Totem Bite State Park.  Went for a VERY wet hike up Deer Mountain and visited its wondrously well-maintained shelter where I spent a solid 15 minutes wringing out clothes and replacing calories.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>Discovered that Wrangell is one of the least talked about gems of the Inside Passage. Extremely few tourists but my visit there contained my two favorite excursions, the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.wrangell.com\\/visitorservices\\/anan-bear-and-wildlife-observatory\\\">Anan Bear Observatory<\\/a> and <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20239836853\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">LeConte Glacier<\\/a>.  Both were run by <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskawaters.com\\\">Alaska Waters<\\/a>, which I cannot recommend highly enough for their friendliness and good humor in accommodating a traveler who showed up with no plans, only hopes.  And, let\'s not forget my little hike up to the top of Mt. Dewey, where John Muir had his infamous fire that scared both the natives and townsfolk of Wrangell back in 1869.  It was his book that led me to take this SE Alaska sojourn in the first place, after all.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>The weather report indicated that in two days a lengthy bit of rainy weather was scheduled to hit SE Alaska, so instead of waiting a day for the ferry and then spending a day on it getting to Juneau, I took a flight to Juneau from Wrangell. It stopped in Petersburg, which was only about 12 minutes away by plane.  Up...and then down.  Then another 50 minutes or so to Juneau.  Along the way the view on the right side of the plane was the Juneau Icefield and it was <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20240059573\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">jaw dropping<\\/a>. Thanks to a conversation on the plane, I shared a cab into downtown with a pilot for one of the cruise lines.  Since the hostel did not open its doors until 5pm, I took the Mount Roberts Tramway 1,800 feet up to the Mountain House and did a quick 45 minute hike up for a better view of Juneau and the all-too-rare sunny day.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>The <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.juneauhostel.net\\\">Juneau Hostel<\\/a> is a bit of a wonder. Only $12 a night + one chore. There is a five night limit though, otherwise it would likely be overloaded by people staying the entire season.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>My next stop in Juneau was a trip to <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673007240\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/lightbox\\/\\\">Mendenhall Glacier<\\/a> the next morning.  I foolishly grabbed one of the tourist buses there for $10 as I did not realize it only went to the Visitor Center and the Mendenhall Lake Campground was on the other side of the lake, over an hour\'s walk away.  While walking a cab came near and I hailed it down.  For $12, I skipped a 90 minute walk and was dropped off right at the West Glacier Trail trailhead.  The hike up was relatively easy and at 3.4 miles in a quick scramble brought you to a nice overlook where I got a <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673078958\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">few beautiful panoramas<\\/a>.  Hiking back down, I took an unmaintained, mildly rugged offshoot trail and headed down to the foot of the glacier to view the moraine and peek into a few ice caves. The weather and glacier were superb and I felt incredibly lucky to have an entire day of clear weather to explore it.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>That evening one of the hostel guests showed me some of her photos from her whale watching tour that day. A group of humpbacks had been bubble net feeding in the area for days and it was truly a sight to see.  Unfortunately, the next morning I discovered the whale tour I had wanted to get one had been canceled because of cruise ships leaving early or changing their tour schedules. Backpackers are a very very small minority of the visitors in SE Alaska and the cruise ships really do run the show. With no other plans, I consulted my handy Lonely Planet guide and learned of the Taku Glacier and Taku Lodge seaplane tour.  Within an hour I was in a plane and flying towards Taku Glacier for a scenic tour of the nearby icefield and a king salmon dinner at the lodge.  And it just so happened that a black bear showed up to clear the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673100940\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">drippings off of the grill<\\/a>.

I foolishly grabbed one of the tourist buses there for $10 as I did not realize it only went to the Visitor Center and the Mendenhall Lake Campground was on the other side of the lake, over an hour\'s walk away.  While walking down the road a cab came near and I hailed it down.  For $12, I skipped a 90 minute walk and was dropped off right at the West Glacier Trail trailhead.  The hike up was relatively easy and at 3.4 miles a quick scramble brought you to a nice overlook where I got a <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673078958\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">few beautiful panoramas<\\/a>. Hiking back down, I took an unmaintained, mildly rugged offshoot trail and headed down to the foot of the glacier to view the moraine and peek into a few ice caves. The day was warm and the there was a decent amount of water flowing from the caves, so I decided to play it safe and not go further in.  The weather and glacier were superb and I felt incredibly lucky to have an entire day of clear weather to explore it.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>That evening one of the hostel guests showed me photos from her whale watching tour that day. A group of humpbacks had been bubble net feeding in the area for days and it was truly a sight to behold.  Unfortunately, the next morning I discovered the whale tour I had wanted to get on had been canceled because of cruise ships leaving early and changing their tour schedules. Since backpackers are a very very small minority of the visitors in SE Alaska, the cruise ships and their schedules really do run the show. With no other plans, I consulted my handy Lonely Planet guide and discovered the Taku Glacier and Taku Lodge seaplane tour.  Within an hour I was in the copilots seat on a plane and flying towards Taku Glacier for a scenic tour of the nearby icefield and a king salmon dinner at the lodge.  It just so happened that a black bear showed up to clear the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673100940\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">drippings off of the grill<\\/a> while we ate.  While the tour was definitely a bit pricey, I have never had such amazing views of a glacier <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20240159833\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">from the air<\\/a> and the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20834871976\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">meal was exceptionally delicious<\\/a>.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>The next day I finally got on the humpback tour but had two hours until it started. Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind\\/rain was blowing at me in a positively abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water found its way inside along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it magically exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubble feeding, diving with flukes in the air, and even one whale breaching. There are videos on my Flickr page but they really do not do the experience justice.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>Thanks to a ferry breaking down, another ferry not running because of severe weather, and an overcrowded hostel I bailed on Juneau a day early and took a flight to Sitka the next morning. Numerous people had expounded upon the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had hit Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new house with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me there with its hippy atmosphere; the effect made even more powerful by the \\\"Free\\\" box on the porch containing a VHS set of the first five original Star Trek movies.  On the way to the hostel I passed a community library built to resemble a TARDIS too.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>The hostel did not open until 6pm, so I walked over to the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskaraptor.org\\/\\\">Alaska Raptor Center<\\/a>, which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teaches the public about Alaska\'s raptor population.  Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.  The entrance had two owls <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20238735164\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">greeting visitors<\\/a> and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds, like a Great Horned Owl. All the birds have names and classrooms around the world can \\\"adopt\\\" a bird and receive materials and lessons to learn more about raptors and conservation.  I wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>The next day I had planned on going for a hike up behind Sitka to the summit of Gavan Hill.  However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the new and well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous with all the recent rain.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good condition, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail itself and even into the forest.  When the water receded, they then became trapped and died. And <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/news\\/2001\\/011001\\/full\\/news011004-4.html\\\">thanks to the ichthyoid corpses<\\/a>, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.  The smell of a healthy, thriving forest is not to be beat.  And even miles up the trail, we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn. Pretty darn incredible.<\\/p><p>By the end of that hike though, I definitely needed to do a bit of laundry and I finally decided that my current shoes had to go. They had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain, mud, salt water, and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even I was finding them too much.  An outfitter in town serendipitously had a nice pair of Brooks in my size for 40% off too. Travel magic, for the win.<\\/p><p>The next day Sitka decided to bring out the pretty. There was a bit of rain in the morning but then sunny the rest of the day.  I grabbed my book and made the most of the day by simply lounging around town.  My tendency to go full bore meant I had not taken a single day off for the entire trip just to relax and enjoy the scenery.  Remedied that.  Saw quite a bit of wildlife too, including two <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20868579641\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">sea lions having dinner<\\/a> in the marina.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>That night I reviewed my credit card balance and decided that after an intense two week whirlwind through SE Alaska that it was time to head back south and start thinking about finding employment once more.

I foolishly grabbed one of the tourist buses there for $10 as I did not realize it only went to the Visitor Center and the Mendenhall Lake Campground was on the other side of the lake, over an hour\'s walk away.  While walking down the road a cab came near and I hailed it down.  For $12, I skipped a 90 minute walk and was dropped off right at the West Glacier Trail trailhead.  The hike up was relatively easy and at 3.4 miles a quick scramble brought you to a nice overlook where I got a <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673078958\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">few beautiful panoramas<\\/a>. Hiking back down, I took an unmaintained, mildly rugged offshoot trail and headed down to the foot of the glacier to view the moraine and peek into a few ice caves. The day was warm and the there was a decent amount of water flowing from the caves, so I decided to play it safe and not go further in.  The weather and glacier were superb and I felt incredibly lucky to have an entire day of clear weather to explore it.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>That evening one of the hostel guests showed me photos from her whale watching tour that day. A group of humpbacks had been bubble net feeding in the area for days and it was truly a sight to behold.  Unfortunately, the next morning I discovered the whale tour I had wanted to get on had been canceled because of cruise ships leaving early and changing their tour schedules. Since backpackers are a very very small minority of the visitors in SE Alaska, the cruise ships and their schedules really do run the show. With no other plans, I consulted my handy Lonely Planet guide and discovered the Taku Glacier and Taku Lodge seaplane tour.  Within an hour I was in the copilots seat on a plane and flying towards Taku Glacier for a scenic tour of the nearby icefield and a king salmon dinner at the lodge.  It just so happened that a black bear showed up to clear the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673100940\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">drippings off of the grill<\\/a> while we ate.

Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind\\/rain was blowing at me in a positively abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water found its way inside along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it magically exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubble feeding, diving with flukes in the air, and even one whale breaching. There are videos on my Flickr page but they really do not do the experience justice.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20240164073\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\" title=\\\"Damp, Damp, Damp\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/farm1.staticflickr.com\\/742\\/20240164073_f5166e7a89_b.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Damp, Damp, Damp\\\"><\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Thanks to a ferry breaking down, another ferry not running because of severe weather, and an overcrowded hostel I bailed on Juneau a day early and took a flight to Sitka the next morning. Numerous people had expounded upon the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had hit Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new house with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me there with its hippy atmosphere; the effect made even more powerful by the \\\"Free\\\" box on the porch containing a VHS set of the first five original Star Trek movies.  On the way to the hostel I passed a community library built to resemble a TARDIS too.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The hostel did not open until 6pm, so I walked over to the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskaraptor.org\\/\\\">Alaska Raptor Center<\\/a>, which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teaches the public about Alaska\'s raptor population.  Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.  The entrance had two owls <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20238735164\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">greeting visitors<\\/a> and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds, like a Great Horned Owl. All the birds have names and classrooms around the world can \\\"adopt\\\" a bird and receive materials and lessons to learn more about raptors and conservation.  I wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><a data-flickr-embed=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20835082006\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\" title=\\\"Gavan Hill Trail - Landslide Closure\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/farm1.staticflickr.com\\/702\\/20835082006_7989960122_h.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Gavan Hill Trail - Landslide Closure\\\"><\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The next day I had planned on going for a hike up behind Sitka to the summit of Gavan Hill.  However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the new and well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous with all the recent rain.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good condition, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail itself and even into the forest.  When the water receded, they then became trapped and died. And <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/news\\/2001\\/011001\\/full\\/news011004-4.html\\\">thanks to the ichthyoid corpses<\\/a>, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.

The weather and glacier were superb and I felt incredibly lucky to have an entire day of clear weather to explore it.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>That evening one of the hostel guests showed me photos from her whale watching tour that day. A group of humpbacks had been bubble net feeding in the area for days and it was truly a sight to behold.  Unfortunately, the next morning I discovered the whale tour I had wanted to get on had been canceled because of cruise ships leaving early and changing their tour schedules. Since backpackers are a very very small minority of the visitors in SE Alaska, the cruise ships and their schedules really do run the show. With no other plans, I consulted my handy Lonely Planet guide and discovered the Taku Glacier and Taku Lodge seaplane tour.  Within an hour I was in the copilots seat on a plane and flying towards Taku Glacier for a scenic tour of the nearby icefield and a king salmon dinner at the lodge.

Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind\\/rain was blowing at me in a positively abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water found its way inside along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it magically exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubble feeding, diving with flukes in the air, and even one whale breaching.

Numerous people had expounded upon the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had hit Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new house with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me there with its hippy atmosphere; the effect made even more powerful by the \\\"Free\\\" box on the porch containing a VHS set of the first five original Star Trek movies.

Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.

However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the new and well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous with all the recent rain.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good condition, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail itself and even into the forest.  When the water receded, they then became trapped and died. And <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/news\\/2001\\/011001\\/full\\/news011004-4.html\\\">thanks to the ichthyoid corpses<\\/a>, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.  The smell of a healthy, thriving forest is not to be beat.  And even miles up the trail, we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn. Pretty darn incredible.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>By the end of that hike though, I definitely needed to do a bit of laundry and I finally decided that my current shoes had to go. They had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain, mud, salt water, and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even I was finding them too much.

Both were run by <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskawaters.com\\\">Alaska Waters<\\/a>, which I cannot recommend highly enough for their friendliness and good humor in accommodating a traveler who showed up with no plans, only hopes.  And, let\'s not forget my little hike up to the top of Mt. Dewey, where John Muir had his infamous fire that frightened both the natives and townsfolk of Wrangell back in 1869.

The flight stopped in Petersburg, which was only about 12 minutes away by plane. A quick up and then immediately back down. Another 35 minutes in the air and then I was in Juneau.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>On the flight to Juneau, the right side of the plane had a  <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20240059573\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">jaw dropping<\\/a> view of the Juneau Icefield. Thanks to a conversation on the plane, I shared a cab into downtown with a pilot for one of the cruise lines.  Since the hostel did not open its doors until 5pm, I walked over took the Mount Roberts Tramway 1,800 feet up to the Mountain House and did a quick 45 minute hike up for a scenic view of Juneau and the all-too-rare sunny afternoon.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.juneauhostel.net\\\">Juneau Hostel<\\/a> is a bit of a wonder.

I foolishly grabbed one of the tourist buses there for $10 as I did not realize it only went to the Visitor Center and the Mendenhall Lake Campground was on the other side of the lake, over an hour\'s walk away.  While walking down the road a cab came near and I hailed it down.  For $12, I skipped a 90 minute walk and was dropped off right at the West Glacier Trail trailhead.

Thanks to a conversation on the plane, I shared a cab into downtown with a pilot for one of the cruise lines.  Since the hostel did not open its doors until 5pm, I walked over took the Mount Roberts Tramway 1,800 feet up to the Mountain House and did a quick 45 minute hike up for a scenic view of Juneau and the all-too-rare sunny afternoon.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.juneauhostel.net\\\">Juneau Hostel<\\/a> is a bit of a wonder.

I foolishly grabbed one of the tourist buses there for $10 as I did not realize it only went to the Visitor Center and the Mendenhall Lake Campground was on the other side of the lake, over an hour\'s walk away.  While walking down the road a cab came near and I hailed it down.  For $12, I skipped a 90 minute walk and was dropped off right at the West Glacier Trail trailhead.  The hike up was relatively easy and at 3.4 miles a quick scramble brought you to a nice overlook where I got a <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673078958\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">few beautiful panoramas<\\/a>. Hiking back down, I took an unmaintained, mildly rugged offshoot trail and headed down to the foot of the glacier to view the moraine and peek into a few ice caves. The day was warm and the there was a decent amount of water flowing from the caves, so I decided to play it safe and not go further in.  The weather and glacier were superb and I felt incredibly lucky to have an entire day of clear weather to explore it.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>That evening one of the hostel guests showed me photos from her whale watching tour that day. A group of humpbacks had been bubble net feeding in the area for days and it was truly a sight to behold.  Unfortunately, the next morning I discovered the whale tour I had wanted to get on had been canceled because of cruise ships leaving early and changing their tour schedules. Since backpackers are a very very small minority of the visitors in SE Alaska, the cruise ships and their schedules really do run the show. With no other plans, I consulted my handy Lonely Planet guide and discovered the Taku Glacier and Taku Lodge seaplane tour.  Within an hour I was in the copilots seat on a plane and flying towards Taku Glacier for a scenic tour of the nearby icefield and a king salmon dinner at the lodge.  It just so happened that a black bear showed up to clear the <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673100940\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">drippings off of the grill<\\/a> while we ate.

Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind\\/rain was blowing at me in a positively abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water found its way inside along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it magically exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubble feeding, diving with flukes in the air, and even one whale breaching. There are videos on my Flickr page but they really do not do the experience justice.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20240164073\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\" title=\\\"Damp, Damp, Damp\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/farm1.staticflickr.com\\/742\\/20240164073_f5166e7a89_b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"max-height: 600px;\\\" rel=\\\"max-height: 400px;\\\" alt=\\\"Damp, Damp, Damp\\\"><\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Thanks to a ferry breaking down, another ferry not running because of severe weather, and an overcrowded hostel I bailed on Juneau a day early and took a flight to Sitka the next morning. Numerous people had expounded upon the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had hit Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new house with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me there with its hippy atmosphere; the effect made even more powerful by the \\\"Free\\\" box on the porch containing a VHS set of the first five original Star Trek movies.  On the way to the hostel I passed a community library built to resemble a TARDIS too.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The hostel did not open until 6pm, so I walked over to the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskaraptor.org\\/\\\">Alaska Raptor Center<\\/a>, which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teaches the public about Alaska\'s raptor population.  Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.  The entrance had two owls <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20238735164\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">greeting visitors<\\/a> and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds, like a Great Horned Owl. All the birds have names and classrooms around the world can \\\"adopt\\\" a bird and receive materials and lessons to learn more about raptors and conservation.  I wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><a data-flickr-embed=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20835082006\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\" title=\\\"Gavan Hill Trail - Landslide Closure\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/farm1.staticflickr.com\\/702\\/20835082006_7989960122_h.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Gavan Hill Trail - Landslide Closure\\\" style=\\\"max-height: 500px;\\\" ><\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The next day I had planned on going for a hike up behind Sitka to the summit of Gavan Hill.  However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the new and well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous with all the recent rain.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good condition, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail itself and even into the forest.  When the water receded, they then became trapped and died. And <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/news\\/2001\\/011001\\/full\\/news011004-4.html\\\">thanks to the ichthyoid corpses<\\/a>, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.  The smell of a healthy, thriving forest is not to be beat.  And even miles up the trail, we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn. Pretty darn incredible.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>By the end of that hike though, I definitely needed to do a bit of laundry and I finally decided that my current shoes had to go. They had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain, mud, salt water, and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even I was finding them too much.  An outfitter in town serendipitously had a nice pair of Brooks in my size for 40% off too. Travel magic, for the win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><a data-flickr-embed=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673312970\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\" title=\\\"Sitka Marina\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/farm1.staticflickr.com\\/766\\/20673312970_c45f3ef4ae_h.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sitka Marina\\\"><\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The next day Sitka decided to bring out the pretty. There was a bit of rain in the morning but then sunny the rest of the day.  I grabbed my book and made the most of the day by simply lounging around town.  My tendency to go full bore meant I had not taken a single day off for the entire trip just to relax and enjoy the scenery.  Remedied that.

Naturally, I went for a hike. Went back up the Mount Roberts Tramway and hiked at full speed towards Mount Roberts.  After an hour, I had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind\\/rain was blowing at me in a positively abusive manner. Even with full rain gear all zipped up, the water found its way inside along my face and neckline.  Turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp.  The whale tour was another trip where it magically exceeded expectations. Over an hour of humpback whales bubble feeding, diving with flukes in the air, and even one whale breaching. There are videos on my Flickr page but they really do not do the experience justice.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p><a data-flickr-embed=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20240164073\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\" title=\\\"Damp, Damp, Damp\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/farm1.staticflickr.com\\/742\\/20240164073_f5166e7a89_b.jpg\\\" style=\\\"max-height: 600px;\\\" rel=\\\"max-height: 500px;\\\" alt=\\\"Damp, Damp, Damp\\\"><\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>Thanks to a ferry breaking down, another ferry not running because of severe weather, and an overcrowded hostel I bailed on Juneau a day early and took a flight to Sitka the next morning. Numerous people had expounded upon the beauty of Sitka and I felt it was worth a visit.  A raging storm had hit Sitka that morning and dumped 2.5 inches of rain in six hours, triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new house with three people inside. When I arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so I walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the Larkspur Cafe.  A very Portland vibe hit me there with its hippy atmosphere; the effect made even more powerful by the \\\"Free\\\" box on the porch containing a VHS set of the first five original Star Trek movies.  On the way to the hostel I passed a community library built to resemble a TARDIS too.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The hostel did not open until 6pm, so I walked over to the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.alaskaraptor.org\\/\\\">Alaska Raptor Center<\\/a>, which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teaches the public about Alaska\'s raptor population.  Another one of those gems of Alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit.  The entrance had two owls <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20238735164\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">greeting visitors<\\/a> and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds, like a Great Horned Owl. All the birds have names and classrooms around the world can \\\"adopt\\\" a bird and receive materials and lessons to learn more about raptors and conservation.  I wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><a data-flickr-embed=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20835082006\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\" title=\\\"Gavan Hill Trail - Landslide Closure\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/farm1.staticflickr.com\\/702\\/20835082006_7989960122_h.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Gavan Hill Trail - Landslide Closure\\\" style=\\\"max-height: 500px;\\\" rel=\\\"max-height: 500px;\\\"><\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The next day I had planned on going for a hike up behind Sitka to the summit of Gavan Hill.  However, when I reached the trailhead (after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since I was hiking solo), I discovered the Sitka Fire Department had closed it because of landslide danger. Phooey!  Considering how much damage I had seen already on the new and well maintained Cross Trail, it was not too surprisingly that the higher, steeper slopes were dangerous with all the recent rain.  Meeting another hosteler, I instead headed up the Indian River trail with him.  The trail was in reasonably good condition, if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about.  Seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail itself and even into the forest.  When the water receded, they then became trapped and died. And <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.nature.com\\/news\\/2001\\/011001\\/full\\/news011004-4.html\\\">thanks to the ichthyoid corpses<\\/a>, the forest was gorgeous and full of life.  The smell of a healthy, thriving forest is not to be beat.  And even miles up the trail, we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn. Pretty darn incredible.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>By the end of that hike though, I definitely needed to do a bit of laundry and I finally decided that my current shoes had to go. They had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain, mud, salt water, and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even I was finding them too much.  An outfitter in town serendipitously had a nice pair of Brooks in my size for 40% off too. Travel magic, for the win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"text-align:center;\\\"><a data-flickr-embed=\\\"true\\\" href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20673312970\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\" title=\\\"Sitka Marina\\\"><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/farm1.staticflickr.com\\/766\\/20673312970_c45f3ef4ae_h.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sitka Marina\\\"><\\/a>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>The next day Sitka decided to bring out the pretty. There was a bit of rain in the morning but then sunny the rest of the day.  I grabbed my book and made the most of the day by simply lounging around town.  My tendency to go full bore meant I had not taken a single day off for the entire trip just to relax and enjoy the scenery.  Remedied that.  Saw quite a bit of wildlife too, including two <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.flickr.com\\/photos\\/133323973@N07\\/20868579641\\/in\\/album-72157657725794351\\/\\\">sea lions having dinner<\\/a> in the marina.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>That night I reviewed my credit card balance and decided that after an intense two week whirlwind through SE Alaska that it was time to head back south and start thinking about finding employment once more.

I suspect if I had not spent five months hiking the Pacific Crest Trail, it would be significantly easier to be concerned about this new, uncertain path I am taking. But I have stepped into this sort of unknown before. Multiple times. Everything always seems to work itself out.

Who eschews adult behaviors like buying a home, having a career, and putting down roots. Who has whittled down his possessions to a single car load. Who rarely dates and cannot think of a single real world example of a relationship that would even work with his personality. And then every chance he gets is trying to convince others that they too can break the chains of modern American life and work to live a better, more interesting life, if they just have the courage.<\\/p><p>I would expect that guy to run off and be perfectly ok. Seems worth knowing too. On the inside though, I am always questioning these little odysseys of mine. Why can I not find a job\\/relationship\\/life that makes me want to settle down and relax a bit?

And, let\'s be honest, even with <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/brew.sh\\\">Homebrew<\\/a> setting up even anything more than a basic web development environment on a Mac was never the most relaxing task. <\\/p><p>I recently took on a project that already had its own development setup using <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/puphpet.com\\\">PuPHPet<\\/a>, which uses Puppet and Vagrant to create the development environment.  While I have had to play with the nginx configuration and add a few items to my deploy scripts, I have not had to tinker too deeply with Homestead.  It just works.  Well...for the most part. I doubt there will ever be a piece of technology that does not give me a bit of lip service, from time to time.<br><\\/p><p>Now with PuPHPet, I have had to actually learn how Vagrant works in a bit more detail.  Having two different VMs running has caused issues with port forwarding, for example.  Accessing MySQL through an SSH tunnel required understanding that PuPHPet was creating a new SSH key each time the machine was created.  And, if trying to log into MySQL via an SSH tunnel, you logged into SSH via the Local VM IP Address (not with localhost and the VM forwarded port).  The article that pointed out that last tidbit of information was from 2014 and half of its information was already out of date.  A very common occurrence in this line of work.<\\/p><p>It\'s weird.  Maybe it is old(er) age but I am slightly nostalgic for the days when development <em>felt<\\/em> a bit simpler. I spend so much time doing research and figuring things out now.   Make an image into a vector so I can export it as an SVG to upload it to an icon creator to have a font library so all of the icons can be colored, styled, and animated using CSS.  Use an MVC Javascript Framework that requires gulp, elixir, underscore, dotenv, etc. to build a Single Page Application using individual components that all need to be browserify<span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\">\'ed into a single JS file with an automatically versioned file.  Let\'s not forget that RESTful API on the backend that has access via OAuth2, outputs via JSON (or is that JSONP?), and has auto discovery thanks to it following HATEOAS.<\\/span><\\/p><p><span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\">Aside: I\'d like to take a moment to point out that OS X\'s autocorrect gave me hell writing that last paragraph. So many unfamiliar words!<\\/span><\\/p><p><span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\">As usual, no real conclusion just a contemplation about how this increase in complexity may actually be a drain on the web.  My vendor directories are rarely under 35MB.  It is a rare modern website that has a page under 1.5MB in files.

Second, if you are running two different applications\\u2013let us say Laravel for the site and <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/craftcms.com\\\">Craft CMS<\\/a> for your blog\\u2013the configuration gets a little tricky as you already have two different <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/nginx.org\\/en\\/docs\\/http\\/ngx_http_core_module.html#location\\\">location<\\/a> blocks.  You cannot simply set up a third location for media files as nginx will only match one.  You can get around this in two ways.  First, by having additional, more specific grep matching for your location blocks or simply by add conditionals to your existing location blocks. I went with the latter.

It does seem incredibly odd that people would spent hours of their day, months of their year, and years of their life on relationships or jobs that are merely OK.<\\/p><p>I mention this only because I am Once Again (TM, patent pending) trying to decide what to do with my life. It waxes and wanes, as you can imagine.  For five months here I have had steady work as a Lead Developer for two startups on a contract basis. Caught up on all the PHP\\/<a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/laravel.com\\\">Laravel<\\/a> skills and have become a fair hand at using <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/vuejs.org\\\">Vue.js<\\/a> for building interactive pages and single page applications.

No reason to stay around working 50-60 hours a week when you have lost faith, no matter how much money they try throwing at you.  My time and energy is way too valuable for that.<\\/p><p>So far, no job has really seized me strongly.  NY Times, Amazon, a couple startups, a few agencies.  Nothing has really pulled me in and said \\\"Go there.\\\"  Two jobs that I was genuinely interested in did not choose me.

Off and on I have dabbled with the <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.mapmyfitness.com\\\">MapMyFitness<\\/a> sites to help figure out how far I ran or what the elevation profile was for a bike ride, but not with any  serious intention to keep it up to date or analyze the data later. In my own way I was being a purist with my belief that the activity itself is the worthier part than any sort of personal record or achievement. My little stab at applying Kantian moral philosophy to athletics.  Gods, I just typed that out and rolled my <em>own<\\/em> eyes at it.  ::slow applause::\\r\\n<\\/p><p>For reasons I cannot really fathom, part of me issued a proclamation stating that 2016 Shall be the Year That Activities Shall be Tracked.  At the end of December, I sat down and created a spreadsheet for January with a row for every single day and columns for my common outdoorsy or athletic activities.  And, to my own surprise, I actually started keeping a record of most everything I did in that spreadsheet. I also downloaded the Strava app onto my phone to help track my runs and bike rides. While the Strava app\'s data is detailed and fascinating, I have been far less diligent with using it as I do not enjoy carrying it on shorter runs or rides when I do not have a backpack. A watch with GPS capabilities might be nice in the future.<\\/p><p>A copy of the current spreadsheet data is below, thanks to Google Drive.  I have a Numbers document that I have been using locally the past few months but the iCloud sharing webpage is godawful slow when rendering the spreadsheet, so I just pulled my Numbers document into Google and fixed a dozen or so formatting issues. May have to switch to using Google Drive completely if I continue sharing this data publicly.

While I am keeping track of time for activities like running, biking and weights, I am completely skipping it for things like swimming, snowshoeing, and alpine touring. Swimming is easily calculable thanks to me being pretty consistent at a 30 minute mile at the moment. Alpine touring and snowshoeing would have to be educated guesses based on my remembrance of the day and any photos I took during the activity. Back of the napkin workings have me missing about 35 hours worth of time.<\\/p><p>So, after 14 weeks, what do I see here? Apparently, I am averaging about 9.3 hours of exercise per week.

Then, you can see in the upper left that it seems to draw a line straight across the map to another point.  Looks Strava completely lost signal for about 20 minutes and did not track any of the running past that last point in the upper left.  Did not regain signal until I was almost a mile back. I think this is the second or third time such a \\\"break\\\" has occurred on a trail run. Biking is typically much better with its data, since it is on a road with a clearer signal from the GPS. Still, I have definitely seen a few cases where because of speed or conditions, a jump or two has happened during a turn or in a valley.<\\/p><p>Strava also has what it calls a Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP) speed, which they describe as an estimate of what your pace would have been if you had been running on flat land, opposed to a grade.  I am sure there is some solid research and math behind their calculations, but for my first mile last Wednesday I ran a 7:25 pace.  Strava informed me that my GAP pace would have been 5:55. Um, I think not. Pretty sure you could put me on a flat mile with a decent tail wind and I would not even come close to a sub-6 minute mile. It\'s a fun thought but I am certainly not taking that GAP pace seriously anytime soon.<\\/p><p>Finally, Strava has \\\"segments\\\" where you can compare yourself against other athletes who have done a similar route. Stirs up one\'s competitive side, which is not a bad thing. Most of the time I fall pretty square in the top 10-12% percentile of people who use Strava.

At the periphery of my knowledge, I knew the app existed and that multiple professional athletes used it to publicly share their training, but for a long time it seemed a bit more serious than I was willing to be, just like my <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/reedmaniac.com\\/blog\\/entries\\/2016-activity-log\\\">training log<\\/a>.<\\/p><p>Curiosity got the better of me though and I wondered how fast I was flying down some of those hills in the West Hills or in the Columbia Gorge. And yes, I craved a bit of bragging rights too. My profile is located <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.strava.com\\/athletes\\/3769422\\\">here<\\/a>.  As you can see my usage is a bit sporadic. Entire months and multiple weeks have no data, despite them being in the middle of prime  running or biking season.  What can I say, I am inconsistent. While I love my phone, I have a tendency to ignore it as a computer device as it seems silly to be so consistently connected to the world when you are Outside\\u2122.   More than a few rides have ended and I discovered much to my chagrin that I had not started Strava at all.  One of those fancy GPS-enabled watches would likely help, but I have not bit that bullet yet.<\\/p><p>As far as the data Strava provides post-run or post-ride, it is quite a bit of fun to see what my average speed is, the elevation gained, and what my mile times are for various sections of my run or ride.  Just recently, during a downhill section on Newberry Rd., I apparently hit a maximum speed of <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.strava.com\\/activities\\/538796948\\\">51.7mi\\/h<\\/a>.  And during a trail run this past week, I was running half my miles at <a href=\\\"https:\\/\\/www.strava.com\\/activities\\/544625411\\\">8 minutes or under<\\/a>.  That is pretty darn fast on both accounts. I am a tiny bit impressed with myself. It makes me think that this more structured approached to training is providing real results. That is a positive feeling.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>However. The data is not entirely reliable. My trail running takes place primarily in Forest Park where there is a copious amount of trees and more than a few ravines, which regularly interrupt GPS or lessen its accuracy.  The trail run I did this past week is a whopper of an example.\\r\\n<\\/p><p><img src=\\\"https:\\/\\/reedmaniac.com\\/blog\\/\\/assets\\/uploads\\/Forest-Park-Strava-Run.png#asset:226:url\\\">\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\r\\nAs you can see the route Strava thinks I followed deviates a non-trivial amount from the actual trail.  Then, you can see in the upper left that it seems to draw a line straight across the map to another point. Seems Strava completely lost signal for about 20 minutes and did not track any of my running past that last point in the upper left.  Did not regain signal until I was almost a mile back. I think this is the second or third time such a huge \\\"break\\\" has occurred on a trail run. Biking is typically much better with its data, since it is on a road with a clearer signal from the GPS. Still, I have definitely seen a few cases where because of speed or conditions, a jump or two has happened during a turn or in a valley.<\\/p><p>Strava also has what it calls a Grade Adjusted Pace (GAP) speed, which they describe as an estimate of what your pace would have been if you had been running on flat land, opposed to a grade.  I am sure there is some solid research and math behind their calculations, but for my first mile last Wednesday I ran a 7:25 pace.  Strava informed me that my GAP pace would have been 5:55. Um, I think not. Pretty sure you could put me on a flat mile with a decent tail wind and I would not even come close to a sub-6 minute mile. It\'s a fun thought but I am certainly not taking that GAP pace seriously anytime soon.<\\/p><p>Finally, Strava has \\\"segments\\\" where you can compare yourself against other athletes who have done a similar route. Stirs up one\'s competitive side, which is not a bad thing. Most of the time I fall pretty square in the top 10-12% percentile of people who use Strava.  Every so often I take a look at the top athletes for a segment and notice oddities.  For a segment I did during yesterday\'s right, most of the top 10% people were doing a 22-25mph pace. The top athlete though? 43mph. Hm. I may be wrong but I have serious doubts that pace is accurate.<\\/p><p>These segments also do not take into account conditions either, so you have to be mindful that your pace for a segment done in winter while running 15 miles will definitely be slower than an athlete who did that segment in summer while only running 6 miles.  Is it really <em>that<\\/em><span class=\\\"redactor-invisible-space\\\"> important? No, not really.  But, if the data and statistics are there, you should understand their faults and adjust your expectations accordingly.<\\/span><\\/p><p>Overall, I enjoy Strava because I can regularly evaluate my baseline and progress during my training. I am definitely getting faster overall.  Yet, on days when I feel tired, my pace definitely suffers. When I do 2 or 3 moderate to hard days in a row, the final day is usually the slowest in whatever activity I am doing. Not always though, which forces me to acknowledge the strong effect that rest, hydration, and nutrition have on my performance.  Strava validates the power of data in training. Further, it is planting the idea firmly in my noggin\' that if I wish to strive for even more performance I need to seriously consider tracking more data, such as heart rate and caloric intake pre, during, and post exercise.<\\/p>\"}}', '2016-04-17 20:44:22', '2016-04-17 20:44:22', '06e6fc07-0943-48b0-b47b-7df96864707a');

when i mention my pacific crest trail thru hike attempt beats organizing that pile of important documents into my filing bin what is the pacific crest trail pct in short it is a 2 650 mile backpacking trail stretching from the california mexico border all the way to canada through the states of california oregon and washington it usually takes a bit under 5 months to complete with most people going north and starting in late april the smithsonian magazine just published a well written article about it the other day you can also look at the pacific crest trail association s website for more details when are you starting april 22nd we fly down to san diego on the afternoon of the 21st and start early the next morning at the mexican border near campo ca map where s a good map of the trail halfmile s maps are the best collection of topographical maps and cover the entirety of the trail if you want a nice simple overview map i suggest this two page color map i will be posting irregular updates of my position on my twitter account and facebook but i am not intending to meet friends acquaintances on the trail or really keep a where is paul page who is this amelia character she is self described as about as even tempered as a hornet and as social as an oyster and is probably my favorite friend having known each other for about nine years through many trials and tribulations we have settled into a calvin hobbesian friendship as near to family as one can be without blood we also both suffer from a certain kind of madness and take a special glee in it and thus are both the kind of people to go backpacking for 5 months while we will be starting at the same time down in campo california and her parents are our resupply coordinators our 10 inch difference in height and rather different personalities means we will be hiking in tandem rather than together on the pct she has a very entertaining blog that you should totally check it out ok what s all this knee talk about in august 2011 i was leading a trip up near mt adams and while jumping down from a ledge my right patella kneecap slammed into a small rock outcropping took out a sizable chunk of skin and made the next two days of traveling rather painful back in town i got an x ray just to confirm there was nothing broken and got fitted with a leg brace to wear for 10 days it improved but was still a bit painful a month later i reinjured it which lead to me seeing an orthopedic surgeon and dropping out of the pre medicine program i was enrolled in physical therapy went well but two and a half months in it took a severe turn for the worse no idea why but it is possible the cartilage was still loosely attached somewhere and finally tore completely that led to arthroscopic surgery that discovered a severe defect in my articular cartilage and cracks throughout they cleaned up what they could but it was not the result they were hoping for what followed was six months of slow difficult physical therapy just to get back to walking in a straight line and pedaling up hills on my bike basically a mess with torn ligament tendon impinged fat pad and the damaged cartilage and so after eight years of soccer decades of trail running and a lifetime spent outdoors i got a bum knee all because i jumped and my knee was half an inch from being in the clear but i have kept on exercising and pushing it so that i have done hour long trail runs snowshoed into a remote fire tower and been training with a 30 pound backpack on 10 12 mile hikes the knee will never be 100% again and it might not handle the pct mileage but i have prepared it as best i can are you excited not so much excited as i am curious very very curious curious to know if my knee will hold up curious to know how my gear will work curious to know who i will meet on the trail curious to see how the trail changes me it s an adventure exploring hiking trying new things seeing new locations meeting new people makes me very curious to see how it all turns out what will you do when you are done this question amuses me i just spent four months planning a five month backpacking trip which i have not even started and you already want to know what i will do next at this point i am waiting to see how the first month of this trip goes only after that will i really get a sense how the rest of my year will shape up i do have ideas though the appalachian mountain club has winter caretakers for their huts in the white mountains and i have always wanted to do that i also just finished up the recertification process for being a wilderness emt and would not mind becoming an instructor for the nols wilderness medicine institute and there is quite a bit of technology and code that i would not mind learning and building with to the point of perhaps taking a full time 9to5 gig with a development firm '),

 ('39', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' despite having rather speedy 4g access in most towns i have been finding it extremely difficult to write anything on the iphone simply is not a big enough screen with the keyboard to make writing enjoyable one of those times when i wonder how an ipad mini would hold up for the most part i am writing these blog posts whenever i get to a town that has a library alas library internet is not overly fast and all the computers are using an old version of internet explorer by default so i have been downloading chrome to make the whole writing situation more palatable that takes a while with the connection speed and then in no time my time is up thus these entries are written quickly and with very little proof reading anyhoo here are a few updates regarding the gear i have been using tarptent contrail with such a lightweight and seemingly easy setup i really thought i would love this tent for my first attempts at both doing a thru hike and going ultralight alas no the desert regions have had rather strong winds and at times difficult ground too hard too sandy since the tent is not freestanding it has been extremely difficult making it robust enough to survive a night of high winds at whitewater creek when the front containing a thunderstorm started coming in my tent collapsed twice despite staking it and using a copious amount of rocks to reinforce the stakes when you stop wanting to set up your tent at all and just cowboy camp every night that is a problem so i threw in the towel and have ordered a new tent big agnes copper spur ul1 from rei it is a bit heavier but it is freestanding and has been praised by other hikers on the trail brooks cascadia 8 shoes love these shoes when i was testing shoes prior to the hiker i always seemed to get sore feet after 8 or 10 miles not with these i have done a 28 mile day in the desert heat and my feet were not sore afterwards they may not be able to survive as much punishment as more dedicated hiking shoes though around mile 340 i noticed that the tread was loose and there were tiny holes where the end of my pinky toe ends thankfully at cajon junction a fellow hiker dingo rented a car and we took a trip to rei two hour trip because of a brush fire that closed the interstate and caused a massive traffic snarl rei to their credit replaced the shoes but with a stern look and voice informing me that these shoes were not meant for this manner of activity we shall see if this pair survives the next 300 500 miles or if the pct abuses it too much even if i have to replace them every 350 miles i think i will stick with them they are simply too light and comfortable gossamer gear mariposa backpack solid light perfect size and so far standing up to the abuse i have put one hole into its big mesh pocket but that was a sharp trekking pole one of the hip pouch zippers seems to be coming loose but i think i can fix that up without any problem the removal sit pad is genius i had my doubts but i use it multiple times a day zpacks 900 fill power down 20 degree sleeping bag this one is tough while up at coon creek cabin at over 8000 feet the temperature dropped to at least 15 degrees fahrenheit i was perfectly cozy in this bag with my long underwear on and a hat however on those nights when the desert only cools to a balmy 58 degrees fahrenheit this bag is much much too warm after hiking 20 miles and eating a solid dinner my legs seem to radiate ungodly amounts of heat i have taken to putting on my sleeping clothes and using the sleeping bag as a blanket only for my top this is not really the fault of the bag but i do miss having a full length zipper so i can better free my legs to the night air while keeping my torso comfortable sawyer squeeze water filter this filter works well it works really well having seen how much people love the inline sawyer filter for their camelbaks is having me contemplating a switch it only takes probably 5 7 minutes to make all the water i will need for a long stretch but it is not as convenient as simply being able to empty the water into your hydration bladder and go no worries virtually no effort hard to not desire that a bit the rei we went to from cajon junction did not have the inline adapter in stock but if i see it later on i might impulse buy it keen socks more details about this will come a bit later the smartwool socks i started with did not survive much past two weeks holes in the heels the keen socks arrived 10 days in and 16 days in they seem to be surviving but thinning a bit in the heels and balls of my feet we shall see how they survive the next two weeks everything else those are the major items will have more likely later but otherwise by gear is living up perfectly to my expectations two things i seem to be constantly low on is duct tape and blister bandaids even with airing out of my feet a few times a day and changing into dry and maybe recently rinsed socks i seem to develop a hot spot or blister every few days my feet are slowly recovering thickening but the desert is a harsh mistress '),

trip for reed college starting tomorrow morning yes that s right i got off the pacific crest trail to lead a backpacking trip everyone seems to find that amusing the timing just worked out so perfectly and i enjoy leading reedies into the wilderness so much that it was awfully hard to say no also the money i will make by leading nine freshmen and two upperclassmen student leaders into the mt adams wilderness will pay for all of my resupplies in washington nice so the last two months were intense and long goodall and i made it through the sierras tired but mostly intact her parents met us again at sonora pass and gave us a tasty dinner and took the unwieldy bear canisters away far far away then we entered what must have been the birthplace of the primal mosquitos as they were there both in force and ferocity entire flocks hunted us for days headnets and deet not optional finally we entered northern california where we enjoyed many days of temperatures near 100 degrees fahrenheit and plenty of volcanic rocks through old shadeless burn areas northern california had more than its fair share of unpleasant days upon finishing the 30 dry stretch that is hat creek rim i remember looking at two fellow hikers lotus and hermes and we all just looked spent shortly after near burney falls i got my worst blister of the entire trip the intense heat combined with volcanic rock caused a large blister to form underneath the callous on the ball of my left foot was hardly able to walk for two days and then my iphone got stolen while at castella which had me psychologically break down for an hour maps notes music photos videos buh bye and then heading into mt shasta where i charmed my way into getting a brand new phone that afternoon and at a reduced cost there were really good days too though in sierra city nearly everyone took at least one zero and i got to catch up with many old hiking friends in seiad city goodall and i spent the night with two reed alums who lived just down the road in happy valley enjoyed a quiet night with showers laundry a home cooked meal and comfy beds and let s not forget that sunset near mt shasta where the sky came alive with mind bogglingly layers of clouds and color near the oregon border we had our first taste of forest fires and their smoke a lightning storm a few days prior had started at least four fires in oregon and their smoke drifted down into california during the long climb out of seiad valley you could hardly see the hillside a couple hundred meters across from you once in oregon ashland and medford had such bad smoke that the outdoor plays were canceled near crater lake i got my first taste of oregon weather schizophrenia not sure what it is but whenever i am on the pacific crest trail during august in oregon i always seem to have first forest fires and then chilling rain naturally i had not checked the weather before leaving ashland and had forwarded my rain pants on thankfully i kept my smartwool beanie as there were a couple wet days followed by chilly nights yet somehow we carried on right around the three sisters wilderness oregon became absolutely gorgeous cookie and i dry camped shortly before obsidian creek and enjoyed a lovely sunset and sunrise to the west of middle sister sadly the next day had us hiking through at least five miles total of volcanic rock near mckenzie pass followed by a long will sucking burn area i am ever so glad i changed my plans and took a night off in sisters gave me a chance to catch up with a former coworker eat good food and just relax before the final push to timberline lodge thanks to the burney falls blister say that three times fast i was a couple days behind schedule in getting to ashland originally my plan was to head off into portland from cascade locks on the 21st no way i was going to make that without risking an injury so since i was mostly hiking alone through oregon i was able to pull off a half dozen 30s and get to timberline lodge on the afternoon of the 20th and that is where dave de mel and brian joined me for a tall glass of stout a joyful ride back to portland dinner at nicolas and a night of scotch tasting for the following night dave and i had organized a pie party where i ate savory and sweet pies of numerous varieties while showing photos from the trip on the tv and talking myself a bit hoarse while at time a social malcontent with introvert tendencies i loved seeing all of my portland friends for the night felt good joyful even which catches us up to today all of the gear is ready and in about an hour i will meet the nine freshmen that i will be taking out starting tomorrow morning relatively easy trip with no more than 6 miles between camps but it does seem like we will have cool temperatures with a chance of rain oh pacific northwest you so crazy upon my return i will take at least one more day in portland if not two and organize my resupply see a few more people and relax and then back up to timberline lodge for four more weeks of hiking up to the canadian border woo hoo '),

 ('111', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' last monday morning september 23rd 2013 i crossed the canadian border and officially became a pacific crest trail thru hiker five months and one day after starting from the mexican border after a quick photo in the cold rain and a signing of the register hidden in monument 78 i promptly continued on hiking an additional eight miles to the road nearing manning park where goodall s parents whisked us away to a quick shower with clean clothes a delicious meal and a four hour ride back across the border via roads this time and home to whidbey island not exactly the smooth cruise to the finish we were expecting in fact it was the most difficult and dangerous part of the entire trip started with a raging thunderstorm the first night out of steven s pass followed by three days of being constantly soaked in freezing rain and staying borderline hypothermic the day we hiked into high bridge for the bus into stehekin we had a surprisingly dry and warm day after a night at the lodge we headed out for a lovely autumn scented day and camped above rainy pass next morning the freezing rain returned and for the next two days the weather cycled between cold rain and snow while we crossed multiple washouts on ridges some of which were 15 deep and required climbing up and down loose slick rock our last night on the trail we got three inches of snow and tracked the last six miles to the monument through puddles of freezing water but we made it and just in time here we are only about five days later and the pacific northwest is getting hammered with another winter storm 1 2 feet of snow and high winds are forecasted for that last section most hikers still on the trail are quitting or buckling down for a few days winter is definitely here and hiking season is reaching a quick close now that i am done i am resting and recovering at the lohrenz shelter for displaced persons on whidbey island for a few weeks all of the gear is clean repaired and stored all photos are edited and captioned for one to view on flickr and i had a job interview for a job in bellingham this past thursday still i feel a bit adrift and am slightly frustrated that i really have nothing to do after five months of hiking nearly every single day it is difficult to simply stop and try to take it easy my body definitely needs the rest though the bottoms of my feet have yet to stop aching and the knees are still requesting more time off as well patience is becoming the word of the day things will come in time healing job exercise money direction i am just ever so curious and ready to start what s next '),

 ('114', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' taking a cue from amelia s first post hike gear review i am breaking my reviews up into slightly more manageable chunks this first one will be about the big three of backpacking the pack the sleeping bag and the tent all totaled these three items were 4 9 pounds of my base weight and cost $975 00 definitely earning the name big three as that is a third of my base weight and about half of my gear cost big agnes copper spur ul1 i originally started out with a tarptent contrail which amelia greatly loved but i found myself becoming more and more annoyed during the first couple weeks thanks to the wind storms and poor staking conditions to the point that there were situations where i really should have put up my tent but i did not want to trouble myself not a good sign so i ordered the big agnes copper spur ul 1 at the big bear lake hostel and had it delivered to the saufleys in agua dulce chose the copper spur for a few reasons it is a free standing tent has a side vestibule compared to the front vestibule on the fly creek and is longer than the fly creek i am 6 1 the weight was around half a pound heavier than the contrail but i got a tent that would not collapse under wind or snow had slightly more head room and if it was a gorgeous night and i just wanted bug protection i could still see the moon stars and the occasional meteor shower was pleased with my choice pros sturdy free standing easy to stake simple setup great for buggy environments dries super quick and tough cons bit heavier than most ul options comfortable but not roomy for a large guy rather pricey if you do not have a famous rei 20% coupon bottom line recommended i was happy with my choice might be tempted to try another ultralight option in the future though ex hexamid if i had spare cash as the weight did bug me a bit zpacks 20 degree down sleeping bag wide x long like many thru hikers i did my research and was intending to use a western mountaineering ultralite down sleeping bag right towards the end of the trip planning phase while reading yet another hiking blog yahb i discovered zpacks the western mountaineering ultralite long was 31 oz while the zpacks wide x long was only 21 7 oz and it was cheaper the zpacks bag is basically what happens when a down quilt and a down sleeping bag have a baby with a couple genetic enhancements it was fantastic the only real downside really had to do with the trail itself quite often a 20 degree bag was overkill in the desert and yet three days later that bag could be indispensable when a freezing cold night happened washington rained on us almost a third of the times so i protected my sleeping bag by putting it inside a trash bag inside a cuben sack inside the trash compactor bag lined part of my pack even with that a handful of times it got a bit damp while unstuffed in my tent pros warm lightweight compressible did not cover my head i suffer from anti mummy tendencies and prefer a hat worked great as a blanket when it was really cold it was amazing cons expensive bit too warm for about half of california constant vigilance required in washington to keep it dry bottom line recommended if i had to do it again i might consider using a higher degree bag and then carrying a liner for the sierras and washington gossamer gear mariposa sadly i do not have a good shot of myself using this backpack in the wild typically i was carrying it on my back so i suppose that is not completely unexpected stock photo to the rescue probably one of the pieces of ultralight gear i was most skeptical about currently i have four other backpacks that i use for all variety of purposes guiding mountaineering quick summit hops from basecamp et cetera for me a pack needs to hold the right amount of gear comfortably for days while making my gear easily accessible surely a pack that ways less than 2 pounds could not handle all of the trials of a thru hike i was wrong except for when it was overloaded with a bear canister and or 6 7 days worth of food it worked perfectly it was meant to carry 35 pounds or less and i think that is spot on go over that and your pack and you will suffer for it the aluminum stays and padding is just not capable of handling more than that amount of weight or strain you have been warned by the way its removable pad for sitting is a great idea i used it constantly during breaks and meals so much in fact that i eventually had to replace it in echo lake hat tip to gossamer gear for that idea pros lightweight cheap durable 2668 miles and still usable perfect volume for a thru hiker cons both grommets came out and had to be repaired with floss and needle not ideal for heavy loads in the sierras i am hard on my gear so i tried to be a bit more gentle with this pack to insure it survived the journey bottom line recommended they informed me via email that they know about the grommet issue and are addressing it for the sierras i think i would have mailed myself one of my heavier and more sturdier packs osprey atmos to make the large loads more comfortable '),

 ('119', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' sleeping pad therm a rest neoair xlite a sleeping pad is critical to any sleeping system nowadays gone is the era when four hobbits would cuddle together underneath an outcropping with their wool cloaks wrapped tightly around them a rock their only pillow if you ask me we have all lost a little of ourselves by letting that go anyhoo pros lightweight compact excellent insulation no slipping cons can be punctured i very foolishly put a bag with a sharp object underneath it in the sierras while elevating my feet went right through both sides thankfully the tenacious tape worked spectacularly and held the rest of the trip also i admit it is a bit noisy at first after the first week or two i stopped noticing bottom line recommended yes oh yes i am not the best sleeper and never having to worry about rocks roots or cold ground was fantastic cooking jetboil sol titanium grease pot snow peak titanium spork purple when you absolutely positively have to boil water quickly the jetboil cannot be beat while most thru hikers were still figuring out where to safely put their alcohol stoves my water was already boiled it is actually so fast that i spent less time boiling the water than finding the food i wanted to eat in my food bag so if all you are doing is rehydrating meals of potatoes oatmeal instant rice noodles et cetera and you are not fond of the wait or issues with alcohol then this is the stove for you however you cannot cook with it well that is not entirely true you can cook with it but it is a pain in the ass i used the ol trusted method of cooking food inside of a freezer bag placed inside the boiling water to cook a few meals did not find it particularly enjoyable or easy during the first week i tried foolishly to cook some noodles in the jetboil completely against the recommendations of the manufacturer there are still burnt marks on the bottom of the pot the stove also sips fuel one of the small 100g canisters typically lasted me 3 weeks when having one or two meals a day a fellow hiker gave me a full canister of one of the larger sizes 230g i think it lasted me all the way from echo lake ca to timberline lodge or a distance of over a thousand miles that is damn impressive if you do choose a jetboil leave the stand at home i never used it the grease pot was a great vessel for my meals lightweight and very resilient to the beatings of a thru hike and during the day i put all of my snacks inside it on the outside of my pack worked out great as for the titanium spork it survived the entire trip completely intact i think the fork aspect is unnecessary though i used it more for opening packages than i ever did for spearing my food pros fast boiling sips fuel lightweight and the envy of morning coffee drinkers with an alcohol stove cons bit heavier than an alcohol stove no simmering fork aspect of spork was not necessary bottom line recommended would probably choose a titanium spoon over the spork and insure it is of a size that it would fit in the pot water treatment aqua mira in retrospect starting with the sawyer squeeze filter was a nice experiment but it should have never gone on the trip even during testing at home i became impatient with the amount of time it took to squeeze a couple litres into my platypus platy bottles especially since the bottles were flexible and did not stand up well when empty thru hikers simply want their gear to work quickly and well but once you leak water onto your pants for the tenth time forget to bring the filter into to the tent on a freezing cold night or have issues back flushing the sawyer filter has failed that test so my backup water treatment was two wee bottles of aquamira once i started using those i never looked back and bought more on amazon and shipped them to myself as necessary towards the end even amelia was using it many people complain online about the 5 minutes required for the two chemicals to react before being put into the water honestly if you think about how long it takes to fill up the bottles go pee and grab a snack you are essentially at 5 minutes i had two 1 litre bottles that i cycled through for drinking that were in one of my side pockets so i added the aquamira and kept on walking 15 minutes later i could drink the water pretty darn easy there are other ways to treat water in the wilderness such as bleach but chlorine dioxide aka aquamira is more effective against cryptosporidium and giardia while also improving the taste of the water and not creating any harmful byproducts pros quick easy reliable better than bleach or filters reasonably cheap cons none unless you are really impatient bottom line recommended water containers bottled water bottles platypus platy bottles when you have to carry more than 2 litres say in most of california except for the sierras the platy bottles are fantastic large capacity lightweight and collapse quite small they only lasted me about 800 miles before developing a leak though for everywhere else and for daily drinking i used bottled water bottles put into a side pocket of my pack replaced them about every three weeks or so digital device iphone 5 best thing ever camera gps navigation email browser music videos damn thing does it all and extremely well and is a phone too while having a digital device is not necessary for a thru hike i would say it is extremely worthwhile when mine was stolen in castella it really knocked me down losing my photos and videos connection to the outer world and entertainment was a huge blow thanks to it happening after a really challenging stretch it was probably the closest i came to quitting thank goodness for an automatic online backup in burney the week before otherwise i might have lost over 500 miles worth of photos and notes since it is an electronic device and you are going backpacking for five months in all kinds of conditions it makes sense that it needs a bit more protection than what is required in civilization i put mine in an incipio case and then a loksak bag to protect it from dust sweat and rain there are a few apps that i recommend you look at halfmile s pct guthook southern ca central ca northern ca oregon washington pcthyoh the halfmile app is based off halfmile s notes and maps which are the maps for the pacific crest trail using your gps coordinates it can tell you where you are on the trail or how to get back to it and also the distance to the next halfmile landmark however after the sierras halfmiles notes are fewer in number and you will start becoming frustrated when you walk by additional water sources or campsites that are never mentioned guthook s apps fills in the blanks with far more water sources springs campsites and additional details photos when you are hiking 20 30 miles a day in all kinds of conditions and terrain it is helpful to know if the next reliable water source or campsite is around that next bend or 6 miles beyond the guthook app was a bit buggy at times and does not give you any calculated distances to destinations but it was regularly updated while on trail so hopefully it will continue improving the pcthyoh app is simply a nice way to cache pct related information on your phone ex pdfs of halfmile s maps found it handy a few times when i wanted to look at halfmile s elevation profiles in my tent eventually i stopped using it as the other two covered 99% of what i needed pros amazing digital multi tool able to order stuff from amazon while on trail replaces physical maps apps for everything cons expensive when you consider contract can be stolen or broken so you have to protect it requires power see next review bottom line highly recommended my favorite piece of gear power scharger 5 high performance solar charger with the iphone being used every single day and there being 4 7 days in between towns it was necessary to have some manner of way to recharge the phone on trail the wandering the wild blog highly praised the scharger 5 so i gave it shot it does not have a battery and the iphone 5 requires a strong steady stream of power which requires that you use it primarily during breaks when there is full sun not a problem in most of california and oregon the only time i had to conserve power was when the charger stopped working manufacturing defect apparently and was without it easily recharged my phone in 1 2 hours perfect for lunch breaks in washington i switched to the suntactics usb battery and sent the charger home that also worked extremely well and could recharge my phone at least 2 times which is perfect for a 4 6 day stretch only complaint there is i think with a bit more engineering work cost they might be able to make the entire device a bit smaller pros simple fast and more reliable than other brands company was extremely responsive when charger stopped working and shipped me a new one via priority mail cons it did break at a rather inopportune time pricey bottom line recommended for california especially if traveling with friends who want to use it too i found their usb battery so reliable though that i would recommend it as a lighter cheaper alternative '),

 ('127', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' when i was building my first aid kit for the pacific crest trail oh so many months ago i was aiming for a balance between weight and what my training would realistically let me handle in the wilderness naturally there is a great deal of disagreement and debate on what should be taken for first aid in the outdoor community both on solo and guided trips on one side is this perfectly valid point from andrew skurka even if i carried 50 pounds of medical equipment and was a certified emt i m still not equipped to treat serious medical problems in the field over the long term based on this he goes to one extreme and carries only what he considers the barest essentials if something more serious goes wrong he pulls out the satellite phone and calls for help on the other end of the spectrum there are organizations like reed college that have a legal obligation to send their guides out with both a satellite phone and a substantial first aid kit one with enough supplies to treat the majority of wilderness medical issues perhaps for days on end as a certified wilderness emt who is trained to handle a serious emergency in the field for days even with minimal resources the severe minimalistic approach to first aid that most thru hikers subscribe to is foolhardy quite a few head out with no more than duct tape and ibuprofen essentially they are operating under the assumption that nothing bad will happen or if it does someone else will rescue them this thin margin of safety would often extend to their food and water a number of thru hikers would be out of food the night before their next resupply or would show up at water sources having been empty for miles while the pct is reasonably well traveled and usually less than a day away from civilization there are 5 7 day sections without a single road and no reliable cell service further even if someone does show up within a short amount of time not always the best assumption itself it does not mean they will have the materials or skills to help you out nature is unreliable and relying on luck is no way to head into the wilderness the boy scount motto rings true be prepared please think clearly about what your skills are and how much you are willing to risk humans and thru hikers especially are a hardy and resilient lot things do go wrong though and if you are not prepared it can cost you dearly shortly after i finished the pct this year a series of snowstorms hit the cascades hikers continued heading out even though they had not adequately prepared for the winter conditions snowshoes extra clothes and food multiple people had to be rescued a few by helicopter because search rescue could not safely reach them by foot they were unprepared for those winter conditions and risked their own lives and the lives of others by their foolishness whether you head into the wilderness for a day hike or an expedition it is grossly irresponsible to be ill prepared for the conditions and challenges of being out there so the most important part of any first aid kit is your mind education and knowing what to bring and how to use it one of the things that bugs me about skurka s opinion is it seems to gloss over the educational aspect of first aid you can do more with bare minimal supplies and training than just minimal supplies i highly suggest that if you are doing any kind of backpacking or hiking you find a wilderness first responder course nearby and take it you will not regret it and it is often a requirement for any sort of guiding if you want to get really serious about wilderness first aid and have a free month look at becoming a wilderness emt i do not recommend taking a wilderness first aid course it is too short and the friends who have taken it did not have a high retention of the material pct first aid kit suppliesone of the critiques that amelia brought against my original pct first aid kit was that i designed it not for myself but for everyone else this is a mindset that i gradually moved away from in the first few weeks my final first aid kit was designed solely for thru hiking mini tweezerssafety pins also useful for hanging socks on the back of the pack mini scissors far better than a knife for cutting moleskin and gauze perfect for trimming dead skin too ace bandage never used given the number of joint injuries out there still seems like a good idea ibuprofenbenadrylloperamide trail food has been known to cause intestinal issues neosporin w pain reliever also useful as a minor lubricant underneath tape to prevent it from sticking to loose skin mac smack s ultimate fix great for cracked and problematic feet also useful for burns and minor cuts johnson johnson sports tape the best athletic tape out there a far better choice than duct tape for hot spots as it sticks better and is also breathable moleskin2nd skin blister pads when things go bad these can really keep you going as the hydrocolloid pad promotes healing and provides light padding one problem is that thru hiker miles causes the outside adhesive to fail in only a couple days while the inner part will continue sticking athletic tape backup was necessary callous cushions when moleskin is not thick enough bandaids only had a few but there are some cuts that really need a bit of protection gauze pads i had a few blisters that went really bad gauze athletic tape gives you absorbent non stick padding also handy for more significant bleeds kt tape discovered this in kennedy meadows it is designed to stick to sweaty skin and provides just a hint of padding during the desert i used this quite a bit on my heels '),

 ('139', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' despite requiring significant allocations of mental resources i am not one to really jabber on about my work recently there is a slight problem in that our main product has not launched yet so we are keeping rather tight lipped about its features and the visual and programmatic design also since a great deal of my work is technical in nature with occasional forays into business matters it is not terribly interesting or accessible to the majority of people as worthy of my time as i find building an api with 200 endpoints and testing load balanced environments with multiple horizontal server resources it lacks a certain dinner hour approachability still i think the time has come to at least start pulling back a bit of the curtain we are a little over a month away from inviting portland individuals companies and non profits to help us beta test and a splash page is already visible at impactflow com just last week i finished setting up a complete staging environment on the amazing laravel forge and we are prepping to start our internal testing at the end of next week the pressure is beginning to build it is quite exciting if a bit stressful so what is this mysterious impactflow impactflow is a marketplace for philanthropy where individuals and businesses manage their giving like investments to support the causes they care most about nonprofits showcase their projects and get matched to funds from donors they know are interested in the work they are doing philanthropy is a big word that has quite a bit of weight behind it at its core it is a catchall term meaning one is trying to make the world better though some manner of giving be it money property or personal time like any product we are trying to solve a problem if you are truly serious about having an impact with your giving it is a messy and inefficient process each non profit has its own website and their specific projects may or may not be on it how their projects impact the community or world at large may not be readily apparent directly investing in specific projects that catch your eye is seldom possible an individual or company can literally spend months searching for the perfect place to give their money yet still end up just writing a check to the non profit as a general donation and only receive monthly emails as a result on the flip side non profits are always searching for funds and donors significant amounts of their budgets are spent researching and applying for grants contacting donors and building corporate relationships to insure their projects are funded smaller community focused non profits are often overlooked and lose out to more publicly recognizable non profits and if they want to promote how their current projects are doing they are limited by the capabilities of their website and social media team if they even have one imagine if you could bring both sides funders and non profits to one place and meet all of those needs funders of any size individuals groups corporations can build their own giving programs to indicate specifically where they want their money to go non profts have all of their projects online and those projects are instantly matched to existing giving programs conversations and collaboration can happen on both sides and once funded the projects can provide direct reports to their donors on progress and impact there is an incredible scope to platform and i cannot discuss the details yet but that is the seed at the core of it we want to move beyond giving as it currently stands and allow it to be treated more as a professional investment when i joined the company as a developer at the end of november i was only the fourth employee and was primarily hired because of my knowledge and experience with the codeigniter framework which i helped build during my time at ellislab two weeks ago i was promoted to vp of engineering and have finished an expansive api foundation for the entire platform using laravel the scope of our work even at this initial launch phase is simply mind bending and our list of future enhancements and features is ambitious to say the least to be frank i took this job because my savings were so depleted after finishing the pacific crest trail that any development position with enough challenge to keep me motivated would have done now after helping to design and build not only the platform but the company itself i have both an equity and personal investment in its success there is a real chance that if the platform is successful this might be the last job i ever have that is a statement i am still surprised to be uttering in public the scars of 2012 still haunt me every day as much as part of me desires to continue the path to becoming a doctor and making the world better that way i can no longer find the will to plunge into that level of financial and temporal debt i lost too much faith and became too greedy for a life without that level of sacrifice but what i can do is use all of my technical skills to help build a company whose mission statement is explicit in its goal to make things better not sure how long i will resist the call of extreme outdoor adventures but i do not mind at least allowing the possibility of sticking around for that '),

 ('142', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' a bumper crop of engagements and weddings appeared this year providing a rather steady stream of pokes from the stick of singlehood gentle reminders that many friends are buying houses taking engagement photos going on long romantic vacations and settling down with a loved one or well providing manservant not saying that i want any of that but it is definitely a continual reminder that relationships do exist and i have been roaming this vast and quiet desert for a while since i have resolved to stay in one place this year and eliminate a significant portion of the financial drain provided by my student loans i have found myself in a position where pursuing a relationship is actually feasible the usual vectors have been investigated socializing in new situations jumping into the world of online dating and when leaving the house actually engaging with people and not shuttering myself in my own thoughts behind a book or computer screen in the end i think the only conclusion one can rightly draw is that dating sucks perhaps it is my analytical approach to life but if this was a scientific experiment one would definitely question if this is the correct approach no significant results and yet other people seem to pull it off i mean how do they do it i do not understand i have read their abstracts skimmed the methods section for hints but no my research keeps on outputting negative results maybe the lab equipment is faulty he mutters to himself online dating seemed rather promising at first set out criteria answer questions and rate them on importance and then find matches in your area you have conveniently eliminated the most difficult hiccups of in person interactions knowing if they are single and interested while also helping to eliminate those whose characteristics you believe would not bode well for a relationship with you and yet wow can you not rely on their algorithms at all when it comes to in person chemistry five minutes in the real world is worth more that a week of talking online and then there is the feeling of being on a marketplace and being forced to prioritize who you interact with first in order to prevent messy complications the site developers have made the entire process fascinating and addictive but in the end it seems woefully inadequate and fraught with opportunities for abuse in person interactions are far more rewarding at least initially eye contact flirting and casual conversational chemistry are genuinely fun ah but then you hit the roadblocks oh not single sigh oh not actually from portland oh does drugs oh she s 22 no nope not even oh she s moving in two months to the other side of the country my forehead is developing a callous from all the facepalms to continue the science metaphor it is like receiving amazing initial results and then finding out it was all a computer glitch it is quite maddening you start getting tired of going into the lab at all and that is just the first step that my friends is just trying to get to the coveted first date maybe it is a combination of my stubborn inner child and slight bias against typical american adulthood but when did people get so serious about their immediate futures is it just because we are now in our 30s without an ounce of exaggeration or sarcasm i tell you i have been on a first date where i would have been greatly served by bringing a full dna and psychological profile so my paternal potential could be efficiently evaluated never have i felt less a person and more a potential sperm donor why have a conversation to determine if you even like me as a person before evaluating the potential of our future offspring and good lord would i not mind talking about my thru hike and my longing for additional adventures without the question of my continued residence in the portland area being immediately brought up my long term plans are unknown and i will offer no guarantees on a first second or third date that i will absolutely be around in three months i simply do not know it is even more ludicrous than employers not wanting to hire me when i admit i might want to move on in a year i can easily fathom a half dozen realistic scenarios where i head off to another continent next year i have been informed this has been interpreted as a fear of commitment fear of being hurt or a wish to play the field a friend has even gone so far as to tell me i should lie more often about what is going on in my head something about how sharing all the thoughts flying through my head scares women off or something like that i got bored midway through the conversation in the end i refuse to be dishonest or misleading while it may serve me poorly in the dating realm it keeps my brain from throwing yet another synaptic tantrum all in all the entire process is ridiculously unrelaxing at this point i am befuddled as to how i was ever in a relationship before it does not seem too much to ask to find a single portland woman in her early 30s with high intelligence a proclivity towards outdoor adventures a working knowledge of absurd humor or science fiction and a willingness to enjoy the first 3 4 weeks of a relationship without requiring assurances about the future and with mutual attraction '),

 ('153', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' back in the month of november mt hood seemed to be preparing us for an excellent season of snow on my first trip up to the mountain the sky was clear the temperature was in the teens and one could circumnavigate timberline lodge itself in snowshoes without a care in the world feet of snow were on the ground at treeline and as you headed up towards silcox hut exposed rock was visible but it seemed only a single storm away from disappearing completely things have gone downhill since then there were a few additional storms with snow but the general trend has been towards melting rather than accumulation here is a photo taken yesterday of mt hood from timberline lodge two months into winter and there is less snow on the mountain today than there was in november my goal of being up in the mountains at either hood st helens or adams once a week to train is completely dashed i went up 5 times before the end of 2014 but have only been up there once in 2015 is it climate change causing such a bleak winter or are we just having an extremely poor season thus far it has been well documented that the glaciers in the pacific northwest are receding at an alarming rate some are gone already most are well on their way to extinction further the usda published a report last september that goes into detail explaining how they predict climate change is going to change the north cascades in the next century how it will affect the resources under their management and possible strategies to cope it is a harrowing read and a rather stark contrast to the us senate s continued unwillingness to accept climate change so what about this year by playing with noaa s online weather data tools you can see the precipitation and temperatures for government camp over the past two months while precipitation is pretty close to normal our temperatures have been repeatedly way too warm instead of fresh snow we have been getting more rain and plenty of melting and here s the kicker it is going to get worse much much worse the whole reason i wrote this entry was because my housemate recently got me into the newsroom and a week ago we saw an episode that dealt with climate change for a quick recap checkout the mother jones fact check article on the episode watching the episode was painful because while you felt smacked down by its heavy handed treatment of the material the reality is that it was completely right we have had this research in our hands for decades yet as a species we have not even applied the brakes this is happening it is extremely bad and the majority of people are paying little to no attention in the united states more than half of our representatives are actively blocking any attempt to even accept that climate change is human caused the scale of the problem is immense greater than anything we have ever faced and so we choose not to face it '),

 ('185', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' so i went to se alaska for two weeks and it was amazing took the alaska marine highway up to ketchikan and saw gorgeous scenic beauty with multiple sightings of whales or at least their spouts and a bit of sun glinting off their backs camping on the deck worked reasonably well for the first night but then the continuous dampness and wind loosened the duct tape a bit too much and nearly everyone moved inside the solariums saved us from hearing the ship s fog horn early in the mornings too ketchikan lived up to its reputation of the first city that cruise lines stop at and being one of the rainiest cities in america did all the general touristy things from visiting the southeast alaska discovery center to watching the salmon spawn up near creek street to seeing totem bite state park went for a very wet hike up deer mountain and visited its wondrously well maintained shelter where i spent a solid 15 minutes simply wringing out my clothes discovered that wrangell is one of the least talked about gems of the inside passage extremely few tourists but my visit there contained my two favorite excursions the anan bear observatory and leconte glacier both were run by alaska waters which i cannot recommend highly enough for their friendliness and good humor in accommodating a traveler who showed up with no plans only hopes and let s not forget my little hike up to the top of mt dewey where john muir had his infamous fire that frightened both the natives and townsfolk of wrangell back in 1869 it was his book after all that led me to take this se alaska sojourn in the first place the weather report indicated that in two days a lengthy bit of rainy weather was scheduled to hit se alaska so instead of waiting a day for the ferry and then spending a day on it getting to juneau i took a flight from wrangell to juneau and skipped the entire boat trip the flight stopped in petersburg which was only about 12 minutes away by plane a quick up and then immediately back down another 35 minutes in the air and then i was in juneau on the flight to juneau the right side of the plane had a jaw dropping view of the juneau icefield thanks to a conversation on the plane i shared a cab into downtown with a pilot for one of the cruise lines since the hostel did not open its doors until 5pm i walked over took the mount roberts tramway 1 800 feet up to the mountain house and did a quick 45 minute hike up for a scenic view of juneau and the all too rare sunny afternoon the juneau hostel is a bit of a wonder only $12 a night one chore there is a five night limit though otherwise it would likely be overloaded by people staying the entire season for such a cheap rate my next stop in juneau was a trip to mendenhall glacier the next morning i foolishly grabbed one of the tourist buses there for $10 as i did not realize it only went to the visitor center and the mendenhall lake campground was on the other side of the lake over an hour s walk away while walking down the road a cab came near and i hailed it down for $12 i skipped a 90 minute walk and was dropped off right at the west glacier trail trailhead the hike up was relatively easy and at 3 4 miles a quick scramble brought you to a nice overlook where i got a few beautiful panoramas hiking back down i took an unmaintained mildly rugged offshoot trail and headed down to the foot of the glacier to view the moraine and peek into a few ice caves the day was warm and the there was a decent amount of water flowing from the caves so i decided to play it safe and not go further in the weather and glacier were superb and i felt incredibly lucky to have an entire day of clear weather to explore it that evening one of the hostel guests showed me photos from her whale watching tour that day a group of humpbacks had been bubble net feeding in the area for days and it was truly a sight to behold unfortunately the next morning i discovered the whale tour i had wanted to get on had been canceled because of cruise ships leaving early and changing their tour schedules since backpackers are a very very small minority of the visitors in se alaska the cruise ships and their schedules really do run the show with no other plans i consulted my handy lonely planet guide and discovered the taku glacier and taku lodge seaplane tour within an hour i was in the copilots seat on a plane and flying towards taku glacier for a scenic tour of the nearby icefield and a king salmon dinner at the lodge it just so happened that a black bear showed up to clear the drippings off of the grill while we ate while the tour was definitely a bit pricey i have never had such amazing views of a glacier from the air and the meal was exceptionally delicious the next day i finally got on the humpback tour but had two hours until it started naturally i went for a hike went back up the mount roberts tramway and hiked at full speed towards mount roberts after an hour i had made it up to a point where the trail was mostly slick rock interspersed with slippery mud and the wind rain was blowing at me in a positively abusive manner even with full rain gear all zipped up the water found its way inside along my face and neckline turned around and showed up for the whale tour looking a bit damp the whale tour was another trip where it magically exceeded expectations over an hour of humpback whales bubble feeding diving with flukes in the air and even one whale breaching there are videos on my flickr page but they really do not do the experience justice thanks to a ferry breaking down another ferry not running because of severe weather and an overcrowded hostel i bailed on juneau a day early and took a flight to sitka the next morning numerous people had expounded upon the beauty of sitka and i felt it was worth a visit a raging storm had hit sitka that morning and dumped 2 5 inches of rain in six hours triggering numerous landslides including one that took out a new house with three people inside when i arrived it was thankfully just a drizzle so i walked the mile into down and had a late breakfast at the larkspur cafe a very portland vibe hit me there with its hippy atmosphere the effect made even more powerful by the free box on the porch containing a vhs set of the first five original star trek movies on the way to the hostel i passed a community library built to resemble a tardis too the hostel did not open until 6pm so i walked over to the alaska raptor center which provides medical treatment to injured birds and teaches the public about alaska s raptor population another one of those gems of alaska that is relatively cheap and well worth a visit the entrance had two owls greeting visitors and then you tour through both indoor and outdoor enclosures full of bald eagles and other birds like a great horned owl all the birds have names and classrooms around the world can adopt a bird and receive materials and lessons to learn more about raptors and conservation i wandered around for an hour absorbing and admiring it all the next day i had planned on going for a hike up behind sitka to the summit of gavan hill however when i reached the trailhead after going out of my way to fetch a bit of bear spray since i was hiking solo i discovered the sitka fire department had closed it because of landslide danger phooey considering how much damage i had seen already on the new and well maintained cross trail it was not too surprisingly that the higher steeper slopes were dangerous with all the recent rain meeting another hosteler i instead headed up the indian river trail with him the trail was in reasonably good condition if you did not mind dead salmon being littered about seems the rains had so swollen the river that the salmon had been able to swim up onto the trail itself and even into the forest when the water receded they then became trapped and died and thanks to the ichthyoid corpses the forest was gorgeous and full of life the smell of a healthy thriving forest is not to be beat and even miles up the trail we saw salmon in the river still heading up to spawn pretty darn incredible by the end of that hike though i definitely needed to do a bit of laundry and i finally decided that my current shoes had to go they had been well used for trail running before the trip and the combination of rain mud salt water and dead salmon had made them so unpleasantly ripe that even i was finding them too much an outfitter in town serendipitously had a nice pair of brooks in my size for 40% off too travel magic for the win the next day sitka decided to bring out the pretty there was a bit of rain in the morning but then sunny the rest of the day i grabbed my book and made the most of the day by simply lounging around town my tendency to go full bore meant i had not taken a single day off for the entire trip just to relax and enjoy the scenery remedied that saw quite a bit of wildlife too including two sea lions having dinner in the marina that night i reviewed my credit card balance and decided that after an intense two week whirlwind through se alaska that it was time to head back south and start thinking about finding employment once more a truly amazing trip highly recommended '),

 ('223', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' as an active outdoorsy geeky and nerdy individual who gobbles up medical studies and gear reviews nearly every single day i have oddly never made a real record of my athletic activities off and on i have dabbled with the mapmyfitness sites to help figure out how far i ran or what the elevation profile was for a bike ride but not with any serious intention to keep it up to date or analyze the data later in my own way i was being a purist with my belief that the activity itself is the worthier part than any sort of personal record or achievement my little stab at applying kantian moral philosophy to athletics gods i just typed that out and rolled my own eyes at it slow applause for reasons i cannot really fathom part of me issued a proclamation stating that 2016 shall be the year that activities shall be tracked at the end of december i sat down and created a spreadsheet for january with a row for every single day and columns for my common outdoorsy or athletic activities and to my own surprise i actually started keeping a record of most everything i did in that spreadsheet i also downloaded the strava app onto my phone to help track my runs and bike rides while the strava app s data is detailed and fascinating i have been far less diligent with using it as i do not enjoy carrying it on shorter runs or rides when i do not have a backpack a watch with gps capabilities might be nice in the future a copy of the current spreadsheet data is below thanks to google drive i have a numbers document that i have been using locally the past few months but the icloud sharing webpage is godawful slow when rendering the spreadsheet so i just pulled my numbers document into google and fixed a dozen or so formatting issues may have to switch to using google drive completely if i continue sharing this data publicly bugger after i made the compiled table i noticed a pretty substantial data oversight while i am keeping track of time for activities like running biking and weights i am completely skipping it for things like swimming snowshoeing and alpine touring swimming is easily calculable thanks to me being pretty consistent at a 30 minute mile at the moment alpine touring and snowshoeing would have to be educated guesses based on my remembrance of the day and any photos i took during the activity back of the napkin workings have me missing about 35 hours worth of time so after 14 weeks what do i see here apparently i am averaging about 9 3 hours of exercise per week if you consider that i normally take two rest days per week and took an entire week off at the beginning of march that means on days i exercise i average two hours of activity not too shabby comparing february and march it is quite apparent that i slashed my running in order to start swimming and also head outside for some biking hiking and alpine touring what is not immediately apparent is that the shorter runs i did in march were done a bit faster resulting in me pulling off an 8 30 mile pace during a trail run today which is a minute faster than my average time in february one rather embarrassing statistic is my time spent stretching 460 minutes in january 295 minutes in february but only 85 minutes in march not a good trend need to work on that in april is it worth having this information i suppose it really depends on my aims for all of this activity i call it training but i am not really training for anything in particular i would not mind finally running all of wildwood in one go and i do have a dream of climbing both mt hood and mt adams in one day why fortune and glory kid fortune and glory neither of those two things are really motivating me to head out though and swimming is not exactly helpful with mountaineering i suspect honestly i simply like knowing that i am in shape enough to handle nearly any activity i can throw at my body _ ツ _ going to keep on tracking though maybe add a few more columns in for things like pace and power output also considering a heart rate monitor as it is all the rage now for serious athletic training and i am a bit curious to know what that cold dark cinder in my chest is doing while i am headed up yet another hill later while walking back from palio tonight 1 5 miles from the house it occurred to me that i made no mention of all the walking i do looking at my iphone s health app it looks like i average around 2 5 miles of walking every single day today alone i walked 8 miles during my travels to food carts and tea coffee shops i do not really consider this exercise per se instead it is a key part of my recovery strategy walking helps loosen up my body after strenuous activity and it also helps me mentally relax especially on these beautiful spring days i definitely think it contributes to how well my body puts up with the strain i put on it '),

 ('225', 'field', '1', 'en_us', ' a year ago when i switched from training for a 50k trail run to training to bike 100 miles for reach the beach i finally downloaded the strava app for my iphone at the periphery of my knowledge i knew the app existed and that multiple professional athletes used it to publicly share their training but for a long time it seemed a bit more serious than i was willing to be just like my training log curiosity got the better of me though and i wondered how fast i was flying down some of those hills in the west hills or in the columbia gorge and yes i craved a bit of bragging rights too my profile is located here as you can see my usage is a bit sporadic entire months and multiple weeks have no data despite them being in the middle of prime running or biking season what can i say i am inconsistent while i love my phone i have a tendency to ignore it as a computer device as it seems silly to be so consistently connected to the world when you are outside more than a few rides have ended and i discovered much to my chagrin that i had not started strava at all one of those fancy gps enabled watches would likely help but i have not bit that bullet yet as far as the data strava provides post run or post ride it is quite a bit of fun to see what my average speed is the elevation gained and what my mile times are for various sections of my run or ride just recently during a downhill section on newberry rd i apparently hit a maximum speed of 51 7mi h and during a trail run this past week i was running half my miles at 8 minutes or under that is pretty darn fast on both accounts i am a tiny bit impressed with myself it makes me think that this more structured approached to training is providing real results that is a positive feeling however the data is not entirely reliable my trail running takes place primarily in forest park where there is a copious amount of trees and more than a few ravines which regularly interrupt gps or lessen its accuracy the trail run i did this past week is a whopper of an example as you can see the route strava thinks i followed deviates a non trivial amount from the actual trail then you can see in the upper left that it seems to draw a line straight across the map to another point seems strava completely lost signal for about 20 minutes and did not track any of my running past that last point in the upper left did not regain signal until i was almost a mile back i think this is the second or third time such a huge break has occurred on a trail run biking is typically much better with its data since it is on a road with a clearer signal from the gps still i have definitely seen a few cases where because of speed or conditions a jump or two has happened during a turn or in a valley strava also has what it calls a grade adjusted pace gap speed which they describe as an estimate of what your pace would have been if you had been running on flat land opposed to a grade i am sure there is some solid research and math behind their calculations but for my first mile last wednesday i ran a 7 25 pace strava informed me that my gap pace would have been 5 55 um i think not pretty sure you could put me on a flat mile with a decent tail wind and i would not even come close to a sub 6 minute mile it s a fun thought but i am certainly not taking that gap pace seriously anytime soon finally strava has segments where you can compare yourself against other athletes who have done a similar route stirs up one s competitive side which is not a bad thing most of the time i fall pretty square in the top 10 12% percentile of people who use strava every so often i take a look at the top athletes for a segment and notice oddities for a segment i did during yesterday s right most of the top 10% people were doing a 22 25mph pace the top athlete though 43mph hm i may be wrong but i have serious doubts that pace is accurate these segments also do not take into account conditions either so you have to be mindful that your pace for a segment done in winter while running 15 miles will definitely be slower than an athlete who did that segment in summer while only running 6 miles is it really that important no not really but if the data and statistics are there you should understand their faults and adjust your expectations accordingly overall i enjoy strava because i can regularly evaluate my baseline and progress during my training i am definitely getting faster overall yet on days when i feel tired my pace definitely suffers when i do 2 or 3 moderate to hard days in a row the final day is usually the slowest in whatever activity i am doing not always though which forces me to acknowledge the strong effect that rest hydration and nutrition have on my performance strava validates the power of data in training further it is planting the idea firmly in my noggin that if i wish to strive for even more performance i need to seriously consider tracking more data such as heart rate and caloric intake pre during and post exercise '),
